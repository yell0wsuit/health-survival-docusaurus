If your walking steadiness is low or very low and you’d like to improve it, talk to your doctor. A physician can provide you with
a set of strength and balance exercises tailored to you or refer you to an exercise program shown to reduce fall risk. You may also
receive guidance on how often you should do the exercises.

These sample exercises can give you a sense of what to expect.

## Sit to Stand

1. Sit on a sturdy chair with your knees in line with your hips and your feet facing forward.
2. With your hands on the sides of the chair, lean forward while keeping your back straight.
3. Push off with both hands to stand up.
4. To sit down, bend your knees, hinge at your hips, reach your hands to the chair, slowly lower your
   hips and sit on chair.

**Repeat 10 times.**

For more support, you can place the back of the chair against a wall. And as you get stronger, go
from two hands to one hand, and eventually do the exercise without using your hands to push off.

## Calf Raises

2. Hold onto table or chair for support.
3. Raise your heels off the floor and rock forward onto your toes.

5. Continue for 10 steps.

**Turn around and repeat 10 times.**
