## Why Walking Steadiness Goes Down

When walking steadiness drops quickly, it’s usually for a specific reason, like an injury. But when it declines over months or years, there could be many reasons and the exact cause may be more difficult to uncover.

Sometimes it may simply be due to the effects of aging on our strength and ability to move. Age can also have an impact on the system in your inner ears that control balance. It may even be due to an underlying condition, medication, vision loss, or other factor. A doctor may be able to help if you can’t identify an obvious cause.

## Why You Should Pay Attention

Walking steadiness has a direct relationship with fall risk. As steadiness goes down, fall risk goes up. As we age, our chances of being injured in a fall increase dramatically and falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury and fractures in older adults.

By tracking your walking steadiness, and monitoring changes over time, you’re able to see changes before they become pronounced. And the sooner you notice a problem, the sooner you can take steps to correct it.

## Exercises That May Help

If your walking steadiness is OK, exercises that improve strength, balance, and flexibility can help you maintain or improve your steadiness—Tai Chi or yoga for example.

If your walking steadiness is low or very low and you’d like to improve it, talk to your doctor. A physician may provide you with a set of strength and balance exercises tailored to you or refer you to an exercise program shown to reduce fall risk. You may also receive guidance on how often you should do the exercises.

These sample exercises can give you a sense of what to expect.

**Sit to Stand:** This exercise can help strengthen the muscles in the upper part of your legs. You can use your hands to help you get up and down. As you get stronger, you can rely on your hands less and less.

**Hip Abduction:** This can strengthen the muscles in your hip that help with balance. As your balance improves, you can also try this exercise without the chair.

## Safety Tips

In addition to improving your steadiness, there are some other things you can do to reduce your risk of falling.

Proper clothing and shoes can help you avoid tripping. Either wear shorts or close-fitting trousers, and consider wearing supportive shoes with soles that don’t flare too much.

To reduce the risk of tripping around your home, remove rugs or secure them with double-sided tape to keep them from moving. You can also install night-lights if you need to get up at night to use the bathroom.

Install sturdy grab bars beside toilets and bath tubs, and inside showers. Non-slip mats or adhesive strips in showers and bath tubs can also help.
