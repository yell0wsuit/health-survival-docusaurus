Some people have regular cycles they can count on like clockwork, while many have cycles that aren’t regular. And for everyone who menstruates, there are certain factors that can impact their cycle—varying it a little or quite a lot.

It’s important to understand these factors and their effects on your cycle. That way you’ll know what to expect, and if a change in your cycle might indicate a change in your overall health.

## Factors That Cause Short Term Changes

Your cycle may temporarily change after a big shift in your exercise routine, weight, sleep, or medication. If you’re in the first year of having your period or if you’re nearing menopause, some variation in your cycles is perfectly normal. If you undergo a medical procedure or experience a lot of stress, this can also have a short term impact.

Some factors have more predictable effects. Pregnancy, for instance, will pause your menstrual cycle. If you breastfeed, you may find that your periods don’t resume for several months after your baby is born and may remain unpredictable for as long as you’re lactating.

If you start using contraceptives, you may see a change in your bleeding, experience spotting, or your periods may pause altogether. Some hormonal methods of contraception prevent ovulation, which means you are unlikely to have a fertile window. With hormonal contraception, pregnancy, and lactation, it can take some time for the body to return to its typical cycle pattern once the factor ends.

It’s important to note that multiple factors can affect you at the same time.

## Factors That Cause Long Term Changes

When something impacts your menstrual cycle, its normal characteristics can be altered.

The pattern or length of your cycles can change, becoming irregular or infrequent. These changes, if persistent, may be a sign of conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid problems, or menopausal transition. As you get older and eventually enter menopause, menstruation stops.

If your periods last for longer than expected on a regular basis, or become heavy, this may also be associated with common conditions such as fibroids or adenomyosis—a benign condition where the uterine lining grows into the muscles of the uterus. If spotting happens persistently, causes can include vaginal infections, polyps, or in some cases cancer. If you notice persistent changes in your cycle, but there’s no obvious connection to a cycle factor, you may want to discuss the change with your doctor at your next appointment.

If you’re tracking your cycle in the Health app, you can add pregnancy, lactation, and contraception as cycle factors. These factors have a more predictable effect on your cycles so Health can take them into account.
