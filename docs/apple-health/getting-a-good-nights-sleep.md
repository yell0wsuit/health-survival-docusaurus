- Make sure your bedroom is cool and dark.
- Try to keep electronics and other distractions out of the bedroom.
- Don’t lie in bed awake. If you’re up for more than 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing until you feel like you’re ready to sleep.


## Off-Cycle Sleep

Getting good sleep during the day can be a challenge. In addition to the tips above, here are some things that may help.

- Try to stick to a consistent sleep schedule if you can.
- Get exposure to bright light while you’re awake at night and avoid sunlight before bed.
- If you can’t get your room dark with shades or curtains, use an eye-mask.
- Ear plugs or white noise can help cancel out sounds that might wake you up.
