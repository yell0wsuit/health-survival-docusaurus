Washing your hands may be your most important protection against getting sick. But only if you do it correctly—and most people don’t. One study showed that as many as 95% of us either wash too fast, use water but no soap, or just don’t wash at all.

## Why Handwashing Matters

Viruses, bacteria, and other germs can be picked up when you touch surfaces, objects, and other people.

A doorknob, a gas pump, a handshake, the chicken you’re making for dinner—these are all opportunities to pick up germs. Then simply rubbing an itchy nose can transfer the germs into your body and you might become infected.

Washing your hands can help to remove those germs and help you stay healthy.

## How Handwashing Helps

Handwashing with soap does two things. First, it lifts particles from your skin so water can rinse them away. Clean, running water alone does this moderately well, but using soap makes it much more effective.

Second, washing with soap helps break certain germs down and render them harmless. Viruses like the one that causes COVID-19, have a thin layer of fat that protects each particle. Rubbing your hands with a good lather of soap for 20 seconds can dissolve the fat layer and destroy the virus.

## Doing It Right

There are four steps to washing your hands correctly: wet, lather, rinse, and dry.

1. Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. Don’t use a sink full of standing water—if it’s been contaminated previously, it can contaminate you.
2. Lather your hands with soap including the backs of your hands, between the fingers, and under your nails. Once soapy, rub vigorously for at least 20 seconds. If you need a timer, hum the alphabet twice.
3. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water to make sure all the particles that have been loosened from your skin get washed away.
4. Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them. Germs can be transmitted more easily to and from wet hands.

If you have kids, try making these steps into a game or song. Be sure to give them frequent reminders to wash up. And most importantly, model good handwashing behavior so they learn from your example.

## When to Wash Your Hands

In general, it’s a good idea to wash your hands every few hours. But there are certain times when you should definitely wash up.

- Right after you come home
- After you’ve been in a public place and touched an object or surface frequently touched by other people
- After going to the bathroom
- After changing diapers or helping a child in the bathroom
- After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
- After touching an animal, or touching pet food or pet waste
- After touching garbage
- Before, during, and after preparing food and before eating
- Before and after tending to a sick person or treating an open wound

## If You Don’t Have Soap, Use Hand Sanitizer

The next best thing to soap and water is hand sanitizer. It’s not as effective, but it can reduce some germs.

When using sanitizer, apply enough to cover your hands thoroughly and rub until they feel dry—at least 20 seconds.

An antibacterial sanitizer or wipe will neutralize some bacteria. Against a virus, however, only a sanitizer that’s at least 60% alcohol will be effective. Baby wipes, antibiotic ointments, and any liquid that’s less than 60% alcohol will not destroy viruses and are not alternatives to washing with soap and water.

Be sure to keep alcohol-based sanitizers away from children because they can be harmful if swallowed.
