It’s important to protect yourself from loud sounds that could impact your hearing. Unlike potentially damaging noise in your environment, you have total control over what comes through your headphones.

## Understanding What’s Considered Loud
The louder the sound, the less time you should be exposed to it. Listening at 80 decibels (dB) for more than 40 hours in a one-week period increases your risk of hearing loss. Raise it 10 dB to 90, and damage can begin after only 4 hours a week. Turn it up over 100 dB, and listening for just a few minutes a week can cause damage.

## What’s the Effect of Loud Headphone Audio on Your Hearing?
Exposure to loud sound can damage the tiny hairs inside your ears that translate sound waves into electrical signals your brain can process. This can result in temporary hearing loss, muffled sounds, or ringing in the ears. Your hearing should improve if you give your ears time to recover.

Permanent damage usually occurs when your ears don’t have a chance to recover because your sound exposure is very loud, very long, or repeated. In general, only an extremely loud sound, like an explosion, can damage your hearing instantly. Most modern headphones can’t create a loud enough sound to cause instant, permanent damage.

## What You Can Do
The best way to protect your hearing is to limit how long and how often you listen at a loud level. You can see your listening habits in Headphone Audio Levels. You can also set a volume limit in Settings to reduce your exposure to loud sound levels.

You can also receive notifications when you’ve gone over different thresholds for safe listening.
