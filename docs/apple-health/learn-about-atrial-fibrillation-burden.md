## What Is AFib Burden?

Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a type of irregular heart rhythm that affects a small percentage of people. AFib is the most common form of irregular heart rhythm, and occurs when the upper chambers of the heart beat out of sync with the lower chambers.

AFib burden is the percent of time someone who has the condition is actually experiencing irregular heartbeats. It’s important to understand that with AFib, not every heartbeat is irregular. In fact, in many cases, the majority of heartbeats are normal.

AFib burden is expressed as a percentage of the amount time a person was in AFib out of the total time they were being monitored. Someone with an AFib burden of 3% spent 3% of the time they were being monitored in AFib. Someone with an AFib burden of 11% spent 11% of the time they were being monitored in AFib.

## Understanding Your AFib

AFib is a serious medical condition that can lead to complications like heart failure and stroke. And because the symptoms vary widely, AFib is often a difficult condition to uncover. Some symptoms are easy to notice, like heart palpitations and chest discomfort. Others are more subtle, like general fatigue, finding it hard to exercise, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness. Still others with the condition will experience no symptoms at all.

If your doctor suspects you have AFib, they might want you to wear a device that monitors your heart rate over a period of several days. Some devices will track your heart rate continuously over this time and report your AFib burden. Others, like Apple Watch, will occasionally record your heart rhythm, then the Health app checks for an irregular rhythm that may be AFib, tracks any events it uncovers, and creates an estimate of how often your heart was in AFib over the course of a week. This is recorded in Health as AFib History.

While AFib burden is an important factor physicians use to guide treatment, it isn’t the only thing they consider. They will want to understand when you developed AFib, how long your episodes last and whether they cause symptoms, and other components of your medical history. And although many treatment protocols include prescribing blood thinners to reduce risk of blood clots and stroke, there is currently no clinical evidence to suggest that AFib burden alone should determine whether a patient should take blood thinners.

## Things That Can Increase AFib Burden

Just as AFib can happen at any time, some patients have certain triggers that can increase the likelihood of an AFib episode. These triggers can be complex and intertwined, and can include drinking too much caffeine or alcohol, lack of exercise, lack of sleep, being overweight, being dehydrated, and other things that cause stress.

If you suspect you have AFib triggers, keeping a diary of food, water, caffeine, and alcohol intake—along with the times you eat and drink—can help determine what your triggers are. It’s also helpful to keep a record of sleep and exercise, which Apple Watch can record, so you can share that information with your care team.

## Things That Can Reduce AFib Burden

Just as certain things can trigger episodes of AFib, individuals can also take steps to reduce their AFib burden. Research suggests that eating a healthy diet, maintaining an ideal weight, and getting moderate exercise five times per week can reduce your AFib burden.
