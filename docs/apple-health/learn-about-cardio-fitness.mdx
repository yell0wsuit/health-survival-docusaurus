Cardio fitness, or cardiorespiratory fitness, is your body’s ability to take in, circulate, and use oxygen. This process relies on vital parts of the body—your heart, lungs, muscles, as well as the blood and blood vessels that connect them. This makes your cardio fitness level an excellent indicator of your overall fitness.

To measure cardio fitness, scientists developed a metric called VO₂ max. This represents the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise. The higher your VO₂ max, the more efficient the system, and the more fit you are. So understanding VO₂ max is useful for everyone—whether you’re an elite athlete, getting in shape, or managing an illness.

VO₂ max should not be confused with SpO₂, which measures a different aspect of your health—the amount of oxygen in your blood.

_Unit: VO₂ max_

High levels of fitness can substantially improve the long-term outlook for your health, while low levels of fitness are associated with substantial long-term risks to your health.

<small>Fitness levels derived from the Fitness Registry and Importance of Exercise National Database (FRIEND).</small>

## How Is VO₂ Max Measured?

A precise measurement of VO₂ max requires specialized equipment and strenuous exercises in a lab or gym. But you can get a predicted VO₂ max using heart rate and motion data from a fitness tracker. For instance, Apple Watch can record your predicted VO₂ max after a few minutes of walking, running, or hiking.

VO₂ max predictions are heavily dependent on your age and sex. They can also be affected by certain prescription heart medications.

## Why You Should Be Concerned If You’re Low

Cardio fitness can be an important predictor of your long-term health. There’s a link between low cardio fitness and a risk of significant health issues down the road. Wherever your cardio fitness level is now, the higher you can safely get it, the better.

## Improving Your Cardio Fitness

Aerobic exercise that raises your heart rate and gets you breathing hard gives you the biggest boost. Workouts such as running, cycling, or high-intensity interval training are great. Even just adding a few hills to your daily walk can be a good place to start.

## When to Talk to Your Doctor

If your VO₂ max is in the low range and you’re considering a big change in your exercise routine, you may want to discuss it with your doctor first—especially if you think an underlying condition could be the cause.

Significant changes in any vital sign can indicate a change in your overall health that’s worth bringing up with your doctor.
