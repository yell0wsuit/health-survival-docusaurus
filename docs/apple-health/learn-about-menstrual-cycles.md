A menstrual cycle is an important part of your health. It’s often called the sixth vital sign because it involves so many parts of the body, including the brain, hormones, ovaries and uterus. Cycles vary from month-to-month and person-to-person. The best way to understand what’s normal for you is by tracking your periods.

## What is the menstrual cycle?

The first day of bleeding is the start of your period and cycle. During the first half of the cycle, hormones prepare an egg for release from the ovary, called ovulation. The five days prior to ovulation, and the day of ovulation itself, are the most fertile days of a cycle. Ovulation occurs about two weeks before the next period is supposed to start as the uterus develops a lining to nurture a fertilized egg. If the egg isn’t fertilized, it disintegrates. Without a fertilized egg, the uterine lining begins to break down and is released from the body through the vagina, starting your next period.

Hormones determine when your period begins, how long it lasts, when you ovulate, and how long before you bleed again. The hormones that have the most impact on cycles are estrogen, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone. Your vital signs, like heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature also change during your cycle. Keeping track of these signs and monitoring your hormone levels with at-home or lab tests can provide insights into your menstrual health.

## What is a typical menstrual cycle?

A menstrual cycle is measured from the first day of one period to the day before the next period. Bleeding typically lasts from four to seven days. A cycle typically lasts around 25 to 30 days and cycles tend to vary more when you’re younger. Cycle length often becomes more consistent or regular as you get older and then becomes less predictable again as you approach menopause. No matter your age, some variation cycle to cycle is expected.

It can also be common to experience symptoms, like cramping, bloating, tiredness, acne, or headaches at certain times in your cycle.

Your typical cycle can be quite different from a friend’s or family member’s and still be normal. What really matters is your normal. Tracking your cycle can help you understand your cycle and period length. Once you know how long your cycle usually lasts, you can look for significant changes which can indicate important changes to your health. For example, if you’re fairly regular and suddenly your cycle gets off track, or if your symptoms become worse, you should bring this up with your doctor.

## Things you should talk to your doctor about

- If you haven’t started your period by the time you’re 16
- If your periods last ten or more days
- If your periods come only once every 90 days, or less frequently
- If your cycles are very irregular, varying 17 or more days between the longest and shortest cycles
- If your periods are so heavy or painful that they interfere with your daily activities
- If you are spotting, which is bleeding between periods
- If menstrual symptoms are interfering with daily activities

## Your Cycle and Fertility

Your cycle can also be used to estimate your fertile window. The fertile window only represents a prediction of when you’re most likely to get pregnant, but it’s possible to get pregnant outside the predicted window. This means fertile window predictions in Health are not an effective method of avoiding pregnancy.

If you are taking a hormonal contraceptive, your cycles and period can vary quite a bit. You should discuss what to expect with your doctor.
