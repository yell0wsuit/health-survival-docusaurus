## Understanding Fertility

In simplest terms, fertility is the ability to conceive, carry a pregnancy, and give birth. Since you’re typically able to get pregnant for only a few days each month, it’s helpful to know when those days actually are in order to increase the chances of getting pregnant if you want to have children, and decrease the chances if you don’t.

Fertility is all about timing. Your ovaries typically release one egg per month during ovulation. This egg travels to the uterus through one of two fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs. Sperm can only survive inside another person’s body for three to five days, so the ideal time for fertilization—called the fertile window—is from five days before ovulation to the day of ovulation itself. If the timing is just right, the egg is fertilized in the fallopian tube and then implants in the wall of the uterus, where it can continue to grow.

With everything that needs to happen for fertilization to be successful, it is not uncommon for someone who is healthy to take several cycles before they can get pregnant.

## Changes During Your Menstrual Cycle

It’s helpful to think of your menstrual cycle not as one long cycle, but as two phases.

During the first phase, the follicular phase, your ovaries are selecting and maturing an egg to be released during ovulation, and the lining of your uterus is preparing to accept a fertilized egg. At the beginning of this phase, the pituitary gland at the base of your brain produces follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Its job is to stimulate the follicles—which are the parts of your ovaries that contain eggs—to prepare the one that’s most ready for fertilization. This process produces estrogen, a hormone which causes the uterine lining to thicken, so a fertilized egg can implant there and grow.

## Menstrual Cycle

Ovulation marks the division between the two phases. When your estrogen levels are high enough, your brain dramatically increases the production of luteinizing hormone (LH). This LH surge is what causes your ovary to release an egg into the fallopian tube.

During the second half of your cycle, the luteal phase, your uterine lining has finished thickening and is awaiting implantation of a fertilized egg. If the egg is fertilized by sperm during its trip through the fallopian tube, it can implant into the lining and grow. If the egg wasn’t fertilized or doesn’t implant, the lining sheds, causing your next period.

## How to track ovulation

Ovulation often occurs 12 to 14 days before your period begins, so one way to track it is on a calendar. Monitoring your periods for a few months can give you an idea of how long your typical cycle is. You can then use that information to predict when your next period may start. Once you know that date, count back 12 to 14 days from there to estimate when you’re likely to ovulate. While this method gives you a good baseline, it’s also less accurate than others.

A more accurate way to track ovulation before it happens is with a home ovulation prediction kit (OPK). These kits measure the amount of luteinizing hormone present in your urine and detect the LH surge, giving you a 24-36 hour window before ovulation occurs.

To confirm ovulation has occurred, you can monitor your body temperature, which rises soon after ovulation and stays elevated until your next period. Since the ovary that released the egg also releases progesterone, you can also use a progesterone test to verify ovulation has occurred.

## When should you talk to your doctor?

- Before trying to conceive, to ensure you’re at your healthiest for pregnancy.
- If you are less than 35 years old and have been unable to get pregnant after trying for twelve consecutive months or if you are 35 years old or older and have been unable to get pregnant after trying for six consecutive months.
- If you have had two or more miscarriages.
- If you do not want to get pregnant and want to learn more about preventing pregnancy.

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Fertile window predictions are just that, predictions. It is possible to get pregnant outside of the predicted fertile window.
- Hormonal contraception often prevents ovulation, so if you’re using this type of medication, you do not have a predictable fertile window.
- After pregnancy, lactating, or discontinuation of hormonal contraceptives, it can take time for your body’s rhythm to return to its own normal, and you may not have regular periods or return of fertility for several months.
