## Why Medication Tracking Is Important
Whether you take one prescription medication or ten, it’s important to keep track of what you’re taking and when. How your body responds to a medication is unique, so tracking what you’re taking can help you understand how well a medicine is working for you. It can also help you remember when you took your last dose and when it’s time for your next. Accidentally taking doses too close together could lead to too much medication in your system which can be unsafe. Taking doses farther apart than prescribed, or skipping them altogether, could result in too little medication in your body, making it less effective.

How you’re supposed to take your medicine is also important to keep track of. For example, some medicines should be taken with food in order to decrease side effects, while others should be taken on an empty stomach so they can be absorbed properly. Adding notes to your tracking method can help ensure you’re taking each one as intended.

## What Are Drug Interactions?

While modern medications are safe and effective, there are certain medications that can react with each other, with the foods you eat, or even with your body’s physiology. This can cause them to be less effective or potentially cause side effects, some which can be dangerous. Your doctor, care team, and pharmacist are trained to look out for these interactions when prescribing or providing medications and having an accurate record of what you’re taking can help them. They should also be able to answer any questions you have about interactions.

There are three main types of drug interactions.

### Drug-to-Drug Interactions

These happen when two or more drugs interfere with each other. The Health app can check for this, and if it finds an interaction, it flags it as one of three risk levels. A Critical Interaction means you should not take these medications together and discuss them with your care team. Taking them together may cause significant side effects or cause your medications to not work as well.

A Serious Interaction means taking this combination may cause significant side effects or cause your medications to not work as well, so you should talk with your care team to see if you should adjust your prescriptions.

A Moderate Interaction means you can take the medications as prescribed, but side effects may occur or your meds may not work as well.

### Drug-to-Food Interactions

Foods can interfere with certain types of medications. For example, grapefruit and grapefruit juice can impact some medications used to treat high cholesterol, high blood pressure, depression, and even allergies. Milk can limit how the body absorbs some antibiotics and thyroid medications. And leafy green vegetables—normally a healthy choice—contain Vitamin K, which can interfere with some blood thinners.

### Drug-Condition Interactions

These occur when you have a health condition that makes it risky for you to take certain medications. For example, if you have high blood pressure, taking certain decongestants can raise your blood pressure even more.

### Other Interactions

Finally, if you drink alcohol, use tobacco or cannabis, or take any type of recreational drugs, have an honest conversation with your doctor or pharmacist about it. For example, combining alcohol with acetaminophen, an over-the-counter pain reliever, can cause liver damage, and combining alcohol with pain medication can be life-threatening. Tobacco and cannabis contain active ingredients which interact with hundreds of prescription medications.

It’s helpful to keep in mind that medication tracking, while useful, is only one tool in safely managing your medication schedule. Please consult with your doctor, pharmacist, family members, and any caregivers to create a plan that works best for you.
