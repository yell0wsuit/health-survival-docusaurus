Hearing loss occurs for a variety of reasons, and you may have better hearing in one ear than the other. Changes to your ears as you age, long-term exposure to loud sounds, or illness can all affect your hearing.

Aging is one of the primary causes for hearing loss. Generally, you can hear more when you’re younger and less as you get older. A quarter of people over 50 and half of people over 80 experience hearing loss. This typically occurs as your ear changes over time and is most often due to the loss of the hair cells in the inner ear that sense sound. Hearing loss can also be genetic or even caused by certain diseases such as meningitis, mumps, and chickenpox.

Hearing loss from loud sounds such as a concert tends to be temporary but can become permanent with repeated exposure. Damage is more likely if your ears don’t have time to recover afterward. In loud environments, it’s a good idea to protect your hearing with earplugs or noise-reducing headphones. If you have an Apple Watch, it can detect loud sounds and alert you when they reach harmful levels.

People also hear sounds in different ways. Some are better at hearing low frequency sounds, such as rolling thunder or a tuba. Others are better at hearing high frequency sounds such as a bird chirping or a whistle. A quiet sound that can be heard perfectly  by one person, might only be heard when it’s loud by another person.

Hearing loss can be hard to detect on your own because it often happens gradually. If you think you may have hearing loss, it can be checked with a quick, painless test. The result is an audiogram or chart of your hearing. Any change in your hearing is measured in decibels of hearing level (dBHL) and represents how loud a sound needs to be in order for you to hear it.

## Levels of Hearing Loss

- No Impairment: 0–25 dBHL
- Mild Impairment: 26–40 dBHL
- Moderate Impairment: 41–60 dBHL
- Severe Impairment: 61–80 dBHL
- Profound Impairment: Above 80 dBHL
