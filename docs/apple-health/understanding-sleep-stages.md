While you’re sleeping, your body goes in and out of different stages of sleep. In general, a sleep stage is determined by the types of brain waves you produce. Most people will cycle through the different stages several times during a sleep session. While scientists and doctors can recognize which stage you’re in, they’re still working to fully understand the impact each stage has on the body.

You may find yourself awake during parts of a sleep session. It’s normal for people to wake up on occasion. It’s possible that you will fall right back to sleep and not remember waking up during the night.

This stage of sleep may play a role in learning and memory. During this stage, your muscles are the most relaxed and your eyes move rapidly from side to side. This is also when most of your dreams occur.

Sometimes referred to as light sleep, this stage is considered just as important as the others. This stage often represents most of your time asleep each night. Brain waves that may be important for cognition occur during this stage.

Also known as slow wave sleep because of the brain wave patterns, this is the stage where body tissues are repaired and essential hormones are released. This stage typically happens in longer periods during the first half of your sleep session. During deep sleep, the body is so relaxed that it can be more difficult to wake up from this stage than others.

## Understanding Your Sleep Stages

There are many misconceptions around sleep stages and the quality of sleep. While some may need more deep sleep, others may not. Scientists and doctors are continuing to explore the purpose of the different stages and the impact they have on the body. By tracking your sleep stages and paying attention to how you feel each morning, you may gain insight into your own sleep.
