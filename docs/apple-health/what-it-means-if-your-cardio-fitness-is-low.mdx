Your cardio fitness levels are something you should definitely pay attention to. Cardio fitness involves vital parts of the body—your heart, lungs, muscles, blood, and blood vessels. This makes it an excellent indicator of your overall fitness.

## What Is Cardio Fitness and How Is It Measured?

Cardio fitness, or cardiorespiratory fitness, is your body’s ability to take in, circulate, and use oxygen. It’s measured with VO₂ max, which is the maximum amount of oxygen your body is able to use during exercise. The higher your VO₂ max, the more fit you are.

You should note that predictions are heavily dependent on your age and sex.

_Unit: VO₂ max_

High levels of fitness can substantially improve the long-term outlook for your health, while low levels of fitness are associated with substantial long-term risks to your health.

<small>Fitness levels derived from the Fitness Registry and Importance of Exercise National Database (FRIEND).</small>

## Why You Should Be Concerned If You’re Low

Low cardio fitness can be a predictor of long-term issues like type-2 diabetes, colon cancer, cardiovascular and coronary artery disease, dementia, and Alzheimer’s.

The good news is that if you raise your VO₂ max now and keep it up, you improve your chances of avoiding these issues later.

## Things That Could Cause Cardio Fitness to Go Down

It’s normal for VO₂ max to decrease as you get older. Other factors that can also cause it to decline include:

- Becoming pregnant
- Medications or conditions that limit your heart rate
- A significant injury or long-term illness

## Improving Your Cardio Fitness

Aerobic exercise that raises your heart rate and gets you breathing hard will give you the biggest boost—like running, cycling, or high-intensity interval training. And even just adding a few hills to your daily walk can help.

## When to Talk to Your Doctor

If your VO₂ max is in the low range and you’re considering a big change in your exercise routine, you may want to discuss it with your doctor first—especially if you think an underlying condition could be the cause.

Significant changes in any vital sign can indicate a change in your overall health that’s worth bringing up with your doctor.
