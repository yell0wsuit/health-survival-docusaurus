Sleep occurs when your body and brain drop into an unconscious, restorative state. While you’re sleeping, many of your body’s basic functions are altered or suspended while other specialized functions happen. You may not remember much of your sleep, but you’re likely to spend about a third of your life in this state.

Sleep can do remarkable things for you. It allows your body to rest and perform some essential maintenance on your memory, hormones, your immune system and other critical functions. It improves the brain’s ability to learn, helps the body fight infection, allows your heart to rest, and can even lower blood pressure. Not getting enough sleep can have adverse affects in all of these areas and others.

So how do you know when you’re getting the right amount sleep? When you wake up and feel rested, you’ve likely gotten enough. The amount of sleep someone needs is highly individual. In general, adults should get 7-8 hours of sleep, kids should get 9-13 hours, and infants need between 12-15 hours.

Over the course of a day, you build up sleep pressure. You may find yourself nodding off or feeling tired. This is your body’s way of saying it needs to sleep.

## About Sleep Stages

There are many misconceptions around sleep stages and the quality of sleep. Scientists and doctors are still exploring the purpose of the different stages and the impact they have on the body. Generally, a stage is characterized by the types of brain waves that happen while you sleep. It’s known that dreams happen during the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage and that deep sleep has a restorative effect on the body. As you sleep, you’re likely to cycle through the different stages multiple times.

## Understanding Your Sleep

Tracking your sleep can help you understand the sleep you’re getting and what may be impacting it. You can keep notes in a sleep journal, log your sleep in an app, or use a device that adds your sleep to Health.
