## The Role of Sunlight in Your Health

It can be easy to spend an entire day inside due to school, a job, time of year, or even the weather. When you don't spend enough time in the sun, it can make it more difficult to fall asleep at night, and even impact your mood and energy. For kids, spending time outdoors in sunlight can help promote healthy eye development.

## The Benefits of Daylight

### Eye Health

Typically, the eyes grow and develop until the age of 20. Spending too much time indoors increases the risk of myopia or nearsightedness. Myopia occurs when the eye grows longer than normal which causes objects that are far away to appear out of focus. Myopia can begin in early childhood and can get worse until the eyes are done developing. 

Children can reduce their myopia risk by spending 80-120 minutes outdoors in sunlight each day. Sunlight helps keep the eye from growing too long thus preventing myopia. Being outdoors also helps the eye learn how to focus on objects farther away.

For kids and adults, time indoors is often spent focusing on things close to you such as a device, a project, or a book. Spending time in sunlight can give your eyes a break and prevent eye strain. If you plan on spending a long period of time outdoors, it’s still a good idea to wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from ultraviolet light.

### Vitamin D

Sunlight also helps the body produce Vitamin D, an essential nutrient that helps the body absorb calcium. Vitamin D and calcium work together to protect and heal bones and teeth. Vitamin D also plays an important role in the immune and circulatory systems.

Your body creates vitamin D with the help of the sunlight absorbed through your skin. During winter, or in parts of the world with less sunlight, it can be difficult to get all the vitamin D you need from being outdoors. You can also find Vitamin D in foods such as egg yolks or fatty fish.

### Mood and Sleep

Spending time outside during daylight can reduce stress and promote positive moods in both children and adults. That’s because sunlight helps your body create serotonin—a hormone that supports many of your body’s key functions such as mood, digestion, and sleep.

When sunlight enters the eye, it tells your body it’s time to be awake and active by producing serotonin. Serotonin helps keep you awake during the day and sleep at night. When you don’t get enough sunlight, it can interrupt your body’s natural sleep-wake cycle or circadian rhythm. That’s why you may find it easier to fall asleep after spending time out in the sun.

## How Much Time Outdoors is Right for Me?

For adults, spending around 20 minutes outside each day can provide you with many of the health benefits outlined above. In children, spending 80-120 minutes outdoors each day promotes healthy eye development. It’s also been shown to have a positive impact on creativity and coordination.

Giving yourself a reason to get outdoors can make it easier to get into the routine of spending time outside. For instance, going for a walk with your partner or pet, finding an outdoor hobby, or making plans with friends outside are simple ways to get your recommended daily sunlight.
