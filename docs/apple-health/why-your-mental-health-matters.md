Your mental health is essential to how you think, feel, and act. It can impact everything from how you relate to other people to your self-esteem and even how well your immune system works. When thinking about how to live a long, healthy life, many people focus on their fitness or physical health. It is just as important to give your mental health the same care and consideration.

## The Connection Between Mental and Physical Health

Your body and mind support one another, which means the actions you take to support your physical health can also benefit your mental health. Caring for your mental and physical health together can have a long-lasting impact on your quality of life, reduce your risk for chronic illness, and increase your longevity.

## What are Emotions and Moods?

The way you experience your mental health is often through your emotions and moods. The main difference between an emotion and a mood is how long they last. Emotions are automatic responses that only last for a moment. Moods are more stable, they can last for days or even weeks.

Emotions can be caused by a personally meaningful experience. The experience can be internal or external, such as when you recall a vacation or watch a scary film. The emotions you feel in those moments occur automatically. They exist to help you make decisions and react quickly. For example, they can tell your body to release hormones, increase blood supply, and speed up digestion.

While emotions typically last a moment, moods tend to be more stable, lasting for days or longer. It may be difficult to know where a mood comes from because they can come from several experiences or may have no identifiable cause. Your moods can be influenced by your personality, the time of year, hormones, and your surroundings. While moods are less intense than emotions, they can still affect how you think about things and your reactions.

Paying attention to the differences between your emotions and moods can give you more insights into your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In Health, you can log both momentary emotions and daily moods to help you get a better sense of what is impacting your state of mind. When you log, it’s also helpful to identify the emotion or mood you’re feeling most along with the things contributing to it. This can help you identify patterns.

## What Contributes to Your Mental Health?

- Spend time outdoors in nature.
- Do something physically active.
- Maintain a consistent sleep schedule.
- Eat regularly and stay hydrated.
- Stay socially connected to others.

Your mental health is the result of a number of factors including your life experiences, physical environment, family history, and biology. These factors can contribute positively or negatively to your mental health. Experiences such as neglect or trauma, can place an individual at a greater risk for developing a mental health condition.

A mental health condition impacts an individual’s behaviors, thoughts, and moods. Some of the most common conditions include anxiety and depression. If left untreated, mental health conditions can interfere with your quality of life. That’s why it’s a good idea to mention any concerns you might have about your mental health with your doctor or care team.

While there are some factors you may not have control over, there are things you can do to support your mental health.
## Why You Should Pay Attention to Your Mental Health

In the same way it’s a good idea to exercise regularly, paying attention to your emotions and moods can help you care for your mental health. You can do this by logging your state of mind and doing daily reflections. These techniques can help you gain a better understanding of changes to your emotions and moods over time.

Daily reflections can help you identify what experiences may be contributing to your emotions or mood. Reflecting on your day can also help you accept and acknowledge your feelings. While you may not be able to change when you experience an emotion, you can control how you respond to that emotion.

Resilience and emotional regulation are two skills that can come from daily reflections and mood logging. Resilience is how well you are able to adapt to life’s challenges or stressful situations. Emotional regulation is how well you can manage and respond to your emotions. You can build these skills by practicing mindfulness, engaging in self-compassion, and seeking support from others.
