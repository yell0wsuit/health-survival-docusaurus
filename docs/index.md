Welcome to the Health and Survival section. This is a place where you can find useful tips and resources on how to stay healthy and safe in various situations.

Health is one of the most important aspects of life. It affects everything we do, from simple tasks like breathing or walking, to more complex ones like playing sports or making decisions. Having good health is not only a physical condition, but also a mental and emotional state. And having good health helps us survive. But survival is not just about avoiding accidents, it is also about living well and enjoying life.

I started this project two years ago in private because I wanted it to be in a completed and polished state, but I never had the chance to finish it. I was busy with other things, and I had trouble finding a suitable solution to host the content. I tried different options, such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish), and [Jacky Zhao's Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).

I first used WordPress, but now I found it unnecessary complex (HTML and stuff). For Obsidian Publish, it costs $8/month, so I looked into Jacky Zhao's Quartz instead. But then later on, I didn't find it satisfying. Finally, I decided to use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which is a simple and elegant solution for creating this page. I like how it looks and how easy it is to use.

In this site, I have collections of health and survival tips from many sources, mainly:
- SAS Survival Guide handbook
- SAS Urban Survival Guide handbook
- Apple Health articles

Take a look at the left/top of the page and check it out!
