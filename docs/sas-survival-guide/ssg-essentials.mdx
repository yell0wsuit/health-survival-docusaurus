Begin by preparing yourself to be a survivor. That means preparation in every sense. This section is concerned with making sure that you have the right equipment for any expedition you undertake. It introduces the idea of carrying a pocket-sized kit of carefully selected key survival aids – which should go with you everywhere.

A knife is your most important survival tool. It must be chosen and used carefully and it must be kept in perfect condition.

Equally important is a personal preparedness, so that you are both physically and psychologically equipped to deal with the stresses and hazards of survival conditions. You must have a clear understanding of survival needs, especially of the need for – and ways of obtaining – water.

## **Essentials for survival**

> **The human species has established itself in almost every corner of the Earth. Even in territories too inhospitable to provide a regular home
mankind has found a way to exploit its resources, whether by hunting or by taking wealth from the ground, and has often pitted its skills against
nature simply for the satisfaction of doing so.**

</figure>

Almost everywhere nature provides the necessities for survival. In some places the provision is abundant, in others very meagre and it takes
common sense, knowledge and ingenuity to take advantage of the resources available. Even more important is the will to survive. Men and women have
shown that they can survive in the most adverse situations, but they have done so because of their determination to do so – without that,
the skills and knowledge in this book will be of little use if you find yourself really up against it.

Survival is the art of staying alive. Any equipment you have must be considered a bonus. You must know how to take everything possible from nature
and use it to the full, how to attract attention to yourself so that rescuers may find you, how to make your way across unknown territory back to
civilization, if hope of rescue is not on the cards, navigating without map or compass. You must know how to maintain a healthy physical
condition, or if sick or wounded heal yourself and others. You must be able to maintain your morale and that of others who share your situation.

Lack of equipment should not mean that you are unequipped, for you will carry skills and experience with you, but those skills and experience must
not be allowed to get rusty and you must extend your knowledge all the time.

We are all used to surviving on our home ground – though we may not think of our lives in that way – but the true survivor must learn
how to survive when taken from familiar surroundings or when those surroundings are drastically changed by man or nature. Anyone, young or old,
from whatever walk of life, can find him or herself in a survival situation. As more and more people fly the globe, sail small boats or cross the
sea in large ones, walk the hills and climb mountains and take their holidays in ever more exotic places, the situations to which they could
become exposed are increasingly diversified.

But survival skills are not only concerned with the extremes of the air crash on a mountain peak, a shipwreck in the tropics or a vehicle
breakdown in the middle of a desert. Every time you fasten a seat belt in a car you are giving yourself a greater chance of survival. Checking
each way before crossing a road or ensuring that an open fire is safe before you go to bed are survival techniques that you carry out
instinctively. It is these habits of mind that you must develop as much as acquiring skills.

The main elements of survival are Food, Fire, Shelter, Water, Navigation and Medicine. To put these in order of priority we use the acronym
**Plan**. No matter where you are in the world this will never change be it the Arctic, desert, jungle, sea or seashore.

#### P – for Protection

You must ensure that you are protected from further danger, e.g. impending avalanche, forest fire or exploding fuel. Always stay on the scene of
the incident as long as it is safe to do so and then make sure you are protected from the elements. This means making a shelter and often lighting
a fire. There are several reasons why you should always stay at the scene:

1. You can utilize the wreckage for shelter, signalling etc.
2. It’s a bigger signature on the ground, making it easier to find.
3. There are probably injured people that cannot be moved.
4. By staying where you are you conserve energy.
5. Because you have booked in and out and have stayed on the route, rescue time will be minimal.

#### L – for Location

The next step after building a shelter is to put out emergency signals. You must draw attention to your position. Do this as soon as possible to
help the rescuers.

</div>
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">Watch Lofty explain the importance of selecting your location when setting up camp.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### A – for Acquisition

While waiting to be rescued, look for water and food to help supplement your emergency supplies.

#### N – for Navigation

Good navigation will keep you on route and will often avert a survival situation. But if you find yourself stranded, always stay where you are.

#### Medical

You must become your own doctor and carefully monitor yourself at all times. Treat blisters as they occur, don’t let them become septic.
Keep an eye on your companions and deal with any unusual problems as they arise. If they are limping, falling behind, or behaving strangely, stop
and treat immediately.

:::tip[EQUIPMENT CHECKLIST]

Before any journey or expedition make a checklist and ask yourself the following questions:

- How long will I be away? How much food do I need for this period and do I need to carry water?
- Have I the right clothing for the climate and enough of it? Is one pair of boots enough or, because of the surface conditions and the
amount of walking, should I take a standby pair?
- What special equipment do I need for the terrain?
- What medical kit is appropriate?

:::

### Be prepared

The Boy Scouts’ motto is the right one. Anyone setting out on a journey or planning an expedition should follow it by discovering as much as
possible about the situations likely to be faced and the skills and equipment called for. It is the most basic common sense to prepare yourself,
to take appropriate gear and to plan as carefully as possible.

Your kit could make the difference between failure and success, but, especially when back-packing, many people initially take too much and have to
learn from bitter experience what they really need and what they could have done without. There is no fun in struggling with a huge pack full of
superfluous items while wishing that you had a torch or can opener with you. Getting the right balance is not easy.

Make sure that you are fit enough for what you plan to do. The fitter you are, the easier and more enjoyable it will be. If you are going
hill-walking, for instance, take regular exercise beforehand and wear in your hiking boots. Walk to and from work with a bag weighted with sand
and get your muscles in condition! Mental fitness is another factor. Are you sure that you are up to the task, have prepared enough and have the
equipment to accomplish it? Eliminate any nagging doubts before you set out.

Always prepare contingency plans in case anything goes wrong. Things rarely go quite according to plan. What will you do if you are prevented from
achieving your objective? What will you do if a vehicle breaks down, or if weather or ground conditions prove more severe than anticipated? If in
a party, how will you regroup if separated? What happens if someone becomes ill?

#### Health checks

Have a thorough medical check and ensure that you have all the necessary injections for the territories through which you intend to travel. There
are vaccinations against yellow fever, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, smallpox, polio, diptheria and tuberculosis, and an anti-tetanus injection is
a must. Allow plenty of time for jabs – the full anti-typhoid protection requires three injections over the course of six months. If
travelling through a malarial region take an adequate supply of anti-malaria tablets. You must start taking these two weeks before your journey,
so that resistance is in the system before you arrive in the risk area, and should keep taking them for a month after your return.

Go to the dentist and get your teeth inspected. Teeth that normally do not hurt can cause considerable pain in cold climates. At least start out
in sound condition.

Make up a medical kit that will cover all your likely needs and, if travelling with a group, ensure that any particular individual medical needs
are covered. If a potential member of the group is not fit, should they be dropped from the party? A difficult decision among friends, but one
that must be made for it is best in the long run. Consider, too, the ability of each member of the group to deal with the challenge of hardship,
risk and endurance that you may meet. Stress often brings out the unknown side of a person, and in planning any group expedition some form of
selection is needed when choosing your companions.

### Research

You can never have too much information about a place you are going to. Contact people who know it already, read books, study maps – and
make sure that you have reliable and up-to-date maps to take with you. Find out about the local people. Are they likely to be friendly and helpful
or are they wary of strangers? Are there local customs and taboos?

The more detailed your knowledge of the way people live – particularly in non-westernized societies, where life is linked much more closely
to the land – the more survival knowledge you will have if you come to need it. Local methods of shelter building and fire making, wild
foods, herbal medicines and water sources will be based on an intimate understanding of the surroundings.

Study your maps carefully, get a feel for the land even before you see it and gain as much knowledge of the terrain as possible: river directions
and speed of flow, waterfalls, rapids and difficult currents. How high are hills and mountains, and what are their slopes like – are they
snow covered? Which way do the ridges run? What kind of vegetation can you expect, what species of trees and where? What might temperatures be and
how different at day and night? When are first and last light? What is the state of the moon, the time and height of tides, the prevailing wind
direction and strength? The weather that can be expected?

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image002.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">Knowing your terrain before you set out is very important for planning what kit to take with you.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Planning

For a group expedition get the members together for frequent discussions of what you aim to achieve. Nominate people for particular
responsibilities: medic, linguist, cook, special equipment, vehicle maintenance, driver, navigator and so forth. Ensure that everyone is familiar
with the equipment and that there are spares where needed – batteries, fuel and bulbs especially.

Divide the project into phases: entry phase, objective and recovery. Clearly state the aim of each phase and work out a time scale. Plan for
emergency procedures such as vehicle breakdown, illness and casualty evacuation.

In estimating the rate of progress, especially on foot, allow plenty of time. It is always better to underestimate and be pleasantly surprised by
doing better. Pressure to keep up to an over-ambitious schedule not only produces tension and exhaustion but leads to errors of judgement and
risk-taking that are frequently the reason for things going wrong. You cannot carry all your water requirement with you but must replenish
supplies as you travel. Water sources will be a major factor in planning any route.

When the route is planned and agreed make sure that others know about it so that you can have expectations of rescue if anything goes wrong. If
you are hiking in the hills inform the police and local mountain rescue centre. Tell them your proposed plan and give times of departure and
expected arrival. If touring by car, log the route with the respective motoring organization. If sailing, check with coastguard and port
authorities.

Always make sure that someone knows what you are planning to do and when, and keep them informed at prearranged stages so that failure to contact
will set alarm bells ringing. Boats and aircraft are strictly controlled in this respect and, if overdue, a search is raised and the route checked
out, effecting rescue. Get into the habit of telling people where you are going and what time you expect to return or reach your next destination.

### Equipment

Being prepared for any eventuality is a tall order if you are on foot and have to carry everything you need yourself. Whatever you carry, you must
ensure that it is up to the job, versatile and robust. It’s a fine balance between what you would like to carry and what you must carry.
When preparing for any adventure, you must take into consideration what the dangers are and how you can overcome these. This is what is called
contingency planning.

The climate, weather and time of year will all help you to determine what to carry, but you must ensure that everyone with you knows how to use
and maintain the specialist kit you decide to take with you. Armed with information from your research you will be able to select your equipment,
matching it to objectives and conditions.

#### Clothing

The correct choice of clothing is so important. If you start out right the chances are that you will succeed. Man is a tropical animal and
can only survive as we are born in the tropics. The moment we leave this area we have to provide our bodies with this tropical environment, hence
the need for clothes. There is no heat in clothing, it only traps what the body produces.

The wind and rain are the most dangerous elements in a temperate climate and the cold in extreme areas like the polar regions. If the heat that is
trapped in the layers of clothing you are wearing is continuously being replaced by wind and rain, you are in danger of hypothermia. In cold
climates layering is the answer so pull on a jersey if it turns cold and waterproofs if it rains. However, if you wear an anorak while carrying a
heavy pack, there is a danger of wearing through the shoulders and lower lumbar region allowing the ingress of water to soak the body. You need a
change of clothing and additional warm garments for when you stop.

In hot climates it is very difficult to get the balance right between comfort and practicality. There has always been a danger of overheating in
extreme conditions caused by wearing heavy clothing while carrying out physical activities. When on the move wear the least amount of clothing
possible and avoid walking in waterproofs if you are too hot, as the condensation generated will soak the inner layers.

Clothing should give good protection and be well-fitting without being restrictive. It must keep you warm and dry but have plenty of ways to keep
the body ventilated so you don’t overheat (if it gets colder you can always put on more).

With all the great breakthroughs in recent years in fabric technology it is worth understanding the pros and cons of the different materials on
offer. Gore-tex&trade; is an excellent material because it is breathable and so keeps you warm and dry while ventilating the body, but it does
have limitations. Breathable materials can only work if they are kept clean. Once they get covered in mud and accumulate grime they are less
effective. Gore-tex&trade; is not robust or hard-wearing and must be looked after. The best way to use Gore-tex&trade; is to walk or climb in
windproof garments and when at rest, put on the breathable kit.

Synthetic materials such as fleece are very popular and in certain conditions outperform natural materials like wool, down or cotton. Having a
zipped front makes a fleece easy to put on and take off and they are also comfortable to walk in. Choose one that is windproof as this is often
all that is needed in most conditions. If it gets colder they can be worn under an outer waterproof giving good insulation. There are also
garments which act like an animal’s skin, using the buffalo system. They have a windproof outer with a man-made fibre pile inside. When wet
they perform like a wetsuit. They are good for walking in cold/wet conditions, and are ideal for boating, canoeing and caving.

As for natural fabrics, wool is still an excellent choice for jumpers as it retains its warmth even when wet. The downside is it stretches and
becomes heavy, so it’s not a good choice for socks.Down is the warmest and lightest of all
natural insulating materials but loses all its heat-retaining qualities when wet. Cotton acts as a wick and draws up all the moisture. So
it’s good to wear in the tropics but not in the cold/wet regions.

Footwear is an important consideration and for serious walking give your feet priority. Break in new boots gradually and harden up your skin with
surgical spirit, starting two weeks before you set off.

For the enthusiast the major consideration in choosing clothing is cost. Surplus stores are very popular for the younger adventurer who loves to
parade in camouflage clothing. Although ex-military kit is good, and cheap, it is already obsolete. The big drawback of wearing camouflage or dark
clothing is the risk of not being found when lost. The reason soldiers wear it is so they cannot be seen which contradicts what you are trying to
do if you get into trouble. Most outdoor clothing is blue or orange, some is reversible, so a contrasting colour will always stand out wherever we
find ourselves. Buy the best clothing you can afford, and take advice from a reputable outdoor shop.

**Remember**: There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.

#### Sleeping bags

Two types are generally available. One kind uses hollow fill, man-made fibre, the other (and more expensive) is filled with down. Down is very
light and gives much better insulation – provided it stays dry. If it gets wet it loses all its insulating properties and is very difficult
to dry out. For conditions that are likely to be wet the man-made fibre will therefore be the better choice. Avoid getting your sleeping bag wet,
however, as sleep will be seriously affected.

Excellent bivouac bags made of breathable material are also available that will keep you dry in place of a tent, but in the long term you cannot
beat a tent which can also be used for cooking and communal activities. Keep your sleeping bag inside the bivy bag and stow it inside a
compression sack to make it as small as possible.Keep the bag clean and use a kip mat or poncho to
lie on.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image003.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">Sleeping bags of man-made fibre will stay much drier in wetter climates than the down-filled variety.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Packs

You need a strong and comfortable backpack to carry all your clothing and equipment. Choose the very best you can afford. It should have tough and
fully adjustable webbing, well secured to the pack’s frame or fabric. Heavy loads can quickly loosen poorly made webbing. It must have a
comfortable hip belt. The secret of wearing a pack is to take the weight securely on the hips – the body’s strongest pivot – not
on the shoulders and back, which quickly strain and tire.

Do you want a pack with an external or an internal frame? Internal frames are lighter and make a pack more easy to stow, but external frames are
stronger, ensure a more even distribution of the load and are especially useful for awkward or heavy equipment – including, in an emergency,
a sick or injured person. A good external frame should carry the pack high up on your body, putting less strain on hips and shoulders, and it
should be designed to allow an airspace between the pack and your back to minimise contact perspiration. A frame adds weight and is more prone to
snag on rocky projections or branches, making progress through dense vegetation a little more difficult, but its advantages more than compensate.

Finally, choose a pack made from a tough, waterproof fabric, preferably with a lace-up hood inside the main sack to prevent water leaking in and
the contents falling out. Side pockets are always useful, but they must have secure zips rather than straps or drawstrings, which do not hold
equipment safely.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image004.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">Choosing a backpack is very important – make sure it’s tough and comfortable to carry.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Stowing kit

If you expect to get wet, stow everything in polythene bags. Pack so that you know where everything is and so that the first things you need are
not buried at the bottom. The sleeping bag is probably the last thing you need so that goes at the bottom. Your tent should be on the top, so
should heavy kit such as radios, which are more easily carried there – though try not to make the pack too high, if you have to cope with
strong winds, for a very high pack will be more difficult to balance and you will expend a lot of energy just keeping upright.

Pack a stove and brew-kit in a side pocket so that you have easy access when you halt. Make sure that foodstuffs that can be
easily squashed or melted are in suitable containers. In a warm climate you can carry food to eat cold and make plenty of hot drinks. In a cold
climate make sure that you have plenty of fats and sugars. The exact rations depend on your taste, but they should be chosen to give a good
balance of vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Take into account the extent to which you will be able to live off the land and
carry a supply of anything unlikely to be available locally.

#### G.P.S

A G.P.S. (Global Positioning System) is an excellent piece of equipment and has taken a lot of skill away from the navigator. Basically these
systems receive radio signals from satellites and can locate your current position, anywhere in the world, and are relatively easy to use. You
need at least two satellites to get a position, but the more the better. It is also useful to note that they are reported to have 95 per cent
accuracy rate. However, in order to work, the satellite transmission must not have any obstructions in its way, such as a tree branch or movement,
so to receive a clear signal you need to be standing still and out in the open. However, if we depend solely on technology our basic skills will
suffer and we will become unstuck if it becomes unserviceable or is lost. G.P.S. is not effective unless you can identify where you are, so stick
to the basics. Map read and navigate normally and use the G.P.S to confirm your navigation or correct it.

When looking to buy a G.P.S there are several considerations to think about: what you’ll be using it for – if walking you will want
the unit to be as light as possible and compact; where you’ll be using it; and if you need it to be waterproof (this is usually a feature of
the heavier models with extra gadgets). Battery life should also be taken into account. Some G.P.S are more complicated than others so choose the
model that you’re happy with. Most have the facility of being able to put in way points (at sea this means the eastern and northern
coordinates and on land these can be campsites, rock formations etc) and there are many convenient hand-held versions and some are even featured
on watches.

There is always a danger with any battery-operated equipment that it lets you down when you need it most. Batteries always discharge faster in the
cold and with age. Recharging facilities are difficult in the wilderness (although solar panel chargers and extra power packs should keep them
charged) and bad connections caused by constant abuse while on the move are a real menace.

Carry the G.P.S around the neck tucked under the jacket. This will minimize the risk of damage and protect it from the weather. Don’t place
it in your pack or leave it lying around.

When planning your route from the map, choose prominent points that can be used as emergency rendezvous. Have these at regular intervals,
preferably every hour of walking. Enter these into the G.P.S and they will keep you on track. Once entered they will offer information as to where
you are in relation to these points and tell you what direction to take to reach them.

#### Radios

For a long expedition in remote territory a radio is a necessity. They tend to be expensive but are well worth the cost; if you cannot afford the
radio, you cannot afford the expedition. Choose a model with the fewest channels available to suit your particular needs. The trouble with
multi-channelled sets is that people get confused and tend to use the wrong ones. Have a working channel that everyone uses at established
schedules. Have a priority channel that you can switch to in an emergency so no one will break into your transmissions. If working with
coastguards/forest rangers etc make sure that your radio is compatible and you know the emergency channel (channel 16); knowing the frequency of
the World Service is also useful. Keep your radio in a safe place, ideally on a person and not in a pack.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image005.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">A radio is essential for a lengthy expedition. Make sure you stay in regular contact with base.</figcaption>
</figure>

Prearrange a signals plan with scheduled calls morning and evening, especially when working in a large party. A signals plan entails people
manning the radio at base and two-way communication is easily made. Make sure that the chosen frequencies will work in the areas you are going to,
and that at least two people in the party are familiar with the working of the radio. Every group on the ground must be in radio contact with
base. They should be allocated a call sign and frequency, and a schedule of calls to be made.

Discourage groups from talking to each other without going through base. This will cause great confusion if not controlled.
Listen out before transmitting otherwise you will interfere with other stations. Everyone has verbal diarrhoea when they talk on the radio so
write down what you want to say before making contact and have pencil and paper ready to make notes and take instructions. This will help to keep
transmissions to a minimum and preserve the batteries.

In the evening give a situation report to base with your location, what you have done and your future intentions. In the morning receive an update
on weather conditions, a time check and other information that base can give you. A noon time call can be used to confirm your position.

If you are tackling a dangerous aspect of the expedition you may want to arrange that base listen out for additional calls so that in an emergency
you can call for help and get a response immediately.

An emergency plan should always be put into operation when two consecutive calls are missed. Even if all is well, if you have not been able to
make contact this will be treated by base as an emergency.

You must return to or stay at the last reported location and await contact. If you are really in trouble base will know where you last were
and where you planned to go to, and the rescue mission can follow.

:::

#### Mobiles

The mobile phone is one of the great inventions of the twentieth century. In an emergency situation it can be a real life-saver. On expeditions
where the radios have failed due to bad weather or the location of the victims, a mobile phone has been used to raise the alarm. A group on
Everest got into trouble as they started their descent after summitting. They tried many times to raise base camp but without success. The leader
phoned his wife in Hong Kong on a mobile phone and reported their situation. She then alerted Kathmandu, who in turn alerted base camp, Everest
and effected a rescue.

Some phones are better than others so it’s worth doing some homework; it’s also essential to check the network coverage with the
service provider before going abroad. Keep one in the car, they are priceless when help is required and a cigarette lighter is a convenient
charger for the battery, providing you have an adaptor. Charging can be a problem in the wild so use your phone wisely, but small, hand-held
manual chargers can now be bought to recharge batteries. With radios and phones it takes less power to listen than to transmit, so make your call
and listen for a reply. Texting is also good for battery life and you need less signal. If nothing is heard don’t despair. With all
electrical kit water/moisture is the enemy. The transmitting side may be working but not the receiving side. Make short calls on the hour. Someone
may be picking up your signal so don’t give up. Once you receive confirmation that the rescue is under way keep the radio/phone on listening
watch.

#### Altimeters

In mountainous areas an altimeter is a good idea. Relating the height recorded can help you determine what contour you are on, and how far it is
to the ridge or summit.

You never have enough kit in an emergency. It’s nice to have G.P.S, phones etc but you can still manage without as long as you have the
ability to improvise and adapt. Learn the basics and use technology for confirmation, rather than depending on it whole-heartedly. Communication
is of the highest importance and must be given priority. It is a safer place as long as you can communicate with the outside world.

Many survival sagas begin because of bad navigation, with people getting lost. Always plan for the worst eventuality.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">Measuring altitude can be very useful in mountainous terrain to estimate how far it is to the a ridge or summit.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Vehicles

Motor vehicles need special adjustment and adaptation to deal with high altitudes and extreme conditions, as well as a thorough overhaul to make
sure they are in tip-top working order. You will need tanks for extra fuel and water as well as spares and modifications.

#### Boats and planes

Whether travelling privately or on a commercial service you must take note of the emergency procedures. Maritime and aviation authorities rule
that passengers must be informed of them and remembering them could save your life.

When you board an aircraft cabin staff point out the emergency exits and advise you on action to take in the event of an emergency. On board ship
you will carry out lifeboat drills and be instructed on how to abandon ship if you have to.

The safest place on an aircraft is as far back in the tail as possible. In a crash this frequently breaks off and most survivors are from this
portion. If you are a passenger in a light aircraft ask the pilot about the trip: how long will it take and what sort of ground will you be flying
over? Attend to details – they count in an emergency. Also, try to keep your kit with you at all times.

:::

:::danger[BE AWARE]

When things go wrong it’s a series of events that compound the situation. The weather deteriorates, the radio is broken, the mobile
phone is lost. Two people have multiple injuries and you are out of water. Never give in. Plan for these situations and you will come through,
but always have a contingency plan. Imagine the worst possible scenario, and train for it.

### The unexpected

How can you prepare for what you do not expect? Preparing for expected difficulties and dangers is difficult enough, but what chance have you of
equipping yourself for the totally unknown disaster? Yet these are the disasters that immediately spring to people’s minds – the
shipwreck and the plane crash or forced landing in unfamiliar and difficult terrain.

This is the reason for this book’s existence. Even more important, however, is to know about a whole range of skills which can be applied
and adapted to all kinds of situations and to develop a way of thinking that enables you to draw upon them to find the solutions to particular
problems. This is the preparation you can make for the unexpected.

But this is not all. You can equip yourself with a few small items which will increase your chances many times over by helping you with some of
the basic necessities of survival. This can tip the balance between failure and success. They will fit in a small container slipped into a pocket
or bag and can be carried anywhere. They are your survival kit. If there is an emergency you will be glad you always carry it.

More bulky, but still compact enough to carry on a belt whenever you are travelling, are a knife and the items which will fit in your survival
pouch (see [_Survival Pouch_](#survival-pouch)).

Without the basics, which these two kits provide, you can still improvise but they will give you a head start.

## **Survival kit**

> **A few key items can make all the difference in the fight for survival. Collect the things listed below. They can all be fitted into a
small container, such as a 2oz tobacco tin, that will be hardly noticeable when slipped into an anorak pocket. Make a habit of always having it with you. Do
not choose something bigger, you may find it inconvenient to carry and leave it out on the one occasion you actually need it. Many people who roll their own
cigarettes carry such a tin.**

Experience has proved that each item earns its place, though
some are more use in some situations than in others: fish hooks, for instance,
may be invaluable in the jungle but less so in the desert.

Polish the inside of the lid to make a mirror-like
reflecting surface and seal it, to be waterproof, with a strip of adhesive tape
which can be easily removed and replaced. Don’t then just forget the tin.
Regularly check the contents, changing any which deteriorate, such as matches
and medicine tablets. Mark all drug containers with use and dosage and a
run-out date when they should be replaced. Pack spare space in the tin with
cotton wool, which will keep the contents from rattling and can be used for
firelighting.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">An example of a survival kit – a well-prepared surivival kit
could save your life</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Matches (1)

Waterproof matches are useful but bulkier than ordinary
non-safety, strike-anywhere matches, which can be made ‘shower-proof’ by
dipping the heads in melted candle fat. To save space, snap off half of each
matchstick.

It is much easier to use matches than to make fire
by other methods but don’t waste them, use only when improvised methods fail.
Take them from the tin one at a time and replace the lid. Never leave the
container open or lying on the ground.

#### Candle (2)

Invaluable for starting a fire as well as a light
source. If made of tallow it is
also fat to eat in an emergency or to use for frying – but be sure it is
tallow; paraffin wax and some other candles are inedible. Tallow does not store
well, especially in hot climates.

#### Flint (3)

Flints will work when wet and they will go on striking
long after you run out of matches. Invest in a processed flint with a saw
striker.

#### Needles and thread (4)

Several needles, including at least one with a very large
eye that can be threaded with sinew and coarse threads. Choose strong thread
and wrap it around the needles. They can be used for repairing or making
clothes in an emergency.

#### Fish hooks and line (5)

A selection of different hooks in a small tin or packet.
Add a few split lead weights. Remember that a small hook will catch both large
and small fish but a large hook will only catch big ones. Include as much line
as possible, it will also be useful for catching birds.

#### Compass (6)

A luminous button compass – but make sure you know how to
read it, as some small compasses can be confusing. A liquid-filled type is
best, but check that it does not leak, has no bubbles in it and is fully
serviceable. The pointer is prone to rust. Make sure it is on its pivot and
swings freely.

#### Snare wire (7)

Preferably brass wire – 60–90cm (2–3ft) should do. Save
for snares, but could solve many survival problems.

#### Flexible saw (8)

These usually come with large rings at the ends as
handles. These take up too much room, so remove them; they can be replaced by
wooden toggles when you need to use it. To protect from rust and breakage cover
it in a film of grease. Flexible saws can be used to cut even quite large
trees.

#### Water sterilizing tablets (9)

For use where water is suspect and you cannot boil. Follow
manufacturers’ instructions. These should only be used when no other purification methods are available as they can cause stomach upsets and nausea.

#### Condom (10)

This makes a good water-bag – holding 1 litre (1&frac34;pt). It
is easiest to fill it from a source that has an abundance of water and a degree
of water pressure, like a waterfall. Alternatively plastic bags can be used.

#### Cotton wool (11)

Compact and easily stored, cotton wool is one of the best
kindling materials available. Also stops the tin’s contents rattling.

#### Whistle (12)

Key item for raising an alert, attracting attention, and
preventing members of a group from getting lost.

#### Pocket knife (13)

#### Pencil (&amp; waterproof paper) (14)

It is essential to keep a record of important survival
information – for instance, the locations of resources or lists of edible local
plants.

#### Safety pin (15)

If you’re on the move and tear your clothes, safety pins
can provide quick repair until you can fix things properly. The same can be
applied for shelter coverings. You can also use the pins as fishing hooks for
catching fish or birds.

#### Waterproof Tape (16)

Use to seal the survival tin. Serves as an all-weather
adhesive with applications ranging from building shelters and tools to securing
medical bandages.

### Additional survival gear

A good survival kit is one that is flexible and dynamic.
When preparing a trip to the wilderness, it is essential to know how your needs
will change depending on the anticipated range of conditions. The following is
a list of basic items needed to build the most comprehensive Survival Kit tailored
around your requirements.

#### Magnifying glass

Can start a fire from direct sunshine and is useful for
searching for splinters and stings.

#### Beta light

Beta lights provide a reliable and continuous light source
for about 15 years. The lights are generally the size of a small coin, are
self-illuminating requiring no batteries, and are ideal for map reading.

#### Plasters

Assorted sizes, preferably waterproof, for minor abrasions
and keeping cuts clean. They can be cut and used as butterfly sutures (see
[_Stitching Wounds_](/sas-survival/placeholder-stitching-wounds)).

#### Medical kit

What you include depends upon your own skill in using it.
Pack medicines in airtight containers with cotton wool to prevent rattling. The
following items will cover most ailments:

- **Analgesic**: A pain
reliever for mild and moderate pain. Paracetamol is ideal for tooth-, ear- and
headaches and brufen (containing ibuprofen) is also an anti-inflammatory and is
good for bruises and sprains. DOSE: one tablet every six hours as needed but can cause
constipation as a side-effect so will help in cases of loose bowels. Not to be
taken by children, asthmatics or people with liver disorders.

- **Intestinal sedative**:
For treating acute and chronic diarrhoea. Immodium is usually favoured. DOSE: two capsules
initially, then one each time a loose stool is passed.

- **Antibiotic**: For general
infections. Tetracycline can be used even by people hypersensitive to
penicillin. DOSE: one 250mg tablet, four times daily, repeated for five to
seven days. Carry enough for a full course. If taking, avoid milk, calcium and
iron preparations or other drugs containing aluminium hydroxide.

- **Antihistamine**: For
allergies, insect bites and stings (may also help in cases of a bad reaction to
a drug). Sleepiness is a side-effect of some brands, so useful as a mild sleeping pill. Do not exceed
recommended dosages or take with alcohol.

- **Anti-malaria tablets**:
Essential in areas where malaria is present. There are types which require only
one tablet taken monthly.

- **Potassium permanganate**:
Add to water and mix until water becomes bright pink to sterilize it, deeper
pink to make an antiseptic and to a full red to treat fungal diseases such as
athlete’s foot. Useful also as a fire lighter.

#### Surgical blades

At least two scalpel blades of different sizes. A handle
can be made from wood when required.

#### Butterfly sutures

Use to hold the edges of wounds together once it has been properly cleaned and sterilized.

## **Survival pouch**

> **In a car, boat or aircraft don’t stow all your kit
separately. Pack a survival pouch, too large to carry in your pocket like your
survival tin but kept where it can be grabbed quickly in an emergency. If you
are on foot keep it outside your backpack, and carry it on your belt. It should
contain fuel, food, survival bag and signalling kit, all packed into a mess tin
(a) which protects the kit and doubles as a cooking utensil. If you fancy a
brew or a snack, it is all there for you and in an emergency it gives you a
first back-up for survival. Anything you use from the pouch must be replenished
as soon as possible.**

#### Mess tin

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image008.webp" />

This is made from aluminium, which is light and strong. A
good cooking utensil, it protects kit packed inside it.

#### Fuel

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image009.webp" />

Preferably you should have solid hexamine fuel tablets in
their own stove container (1). Use sparingly when a wood fire is inconvenient.
They make excellent fire lighters. The stove simply unfolds to form an
adjustable pot stand (2) and holder for burning fuel.

#### Torch

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image010.webp" />

Pack a small pencil-like torch (3) that takes up little
room. Keep batteries inside it, but reverse the last so that, if accidentally
switched on, the batteries don’t run down. Many modern torches use
light-emitting diodes (LED) as their light source rather than conventional
bulbs. They use less battery power and will typically work continuously for two
weeks.

#### Flares

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image011.webp" />

Signal flares (4) to attract attention, especially in
close country. Carry red and green miniflares (5) and a discharger (6) (no
bigger than a fountain pen). These are explosive so pack carefully. Simply
remove discharger and screw on to flare (7). Withdraw flare and point skywards
at arm’s length. Pull the trigger to fire.

#### Marker panel

A strip or bar of fluorescent material about 0.3 x 2m (1 x
6ft) used to attract attention in an emergency (see [Signalling](#signalling)).
One bar signals immediate evacuation. Form other signals with panels carried by
others in your party. Pack to stop the other items in the pouch rattling. A
silver thermal blanket is ideal for this.

#### Matches

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image012.webp" />

Pack as many matches (8) as possible in a waterproof
container, you never have enough. Movement against each other can ignite non-safety
matches – pack carefully.

#### Brew kit

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image013.webp" />

There is nothing like a brew-up to restore morale. Pack
tea powder and sachets of milk and sugar (9). Tea quenches thirst – coffee
aggravates it!

#### Food

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image014.webp" />

Fat is the hardest food to come by when living off the land.
Its extra calories earn it a place in your kit – tubes of butter, lard or ghee
(10) are available. Dehydrated meat blocks (11) are nourishing and sustaining,
though not very good in flavour. Chocolate (12) is a good food, but does not
keep well – check regularly. Salt (13) MUST be included – or, better still, an
electrolite powder which contains vitamins, salt and other minerals that the
body requires.

#### Survival bag

A large polythene bag about 200 x 60cm (7 x 2ft) is a
life-saver in the cold. In an emergency get inside to reduce heat loss.
Although wet from condensation you will be warm. Even better is a
heat-insulated bag made of reflective material that keeps you warm and solves
the condensation problem.

#### Survival log

Keep a written log of all events. Do not trust your
memory. Record discoveries of resources, and of what works and what does not.
It becomes a valuable reference and making it helps keep up your morale.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image015.webp" />

#### Pouch

The pouch must be made from waterproof material and be large
enough to take a mess tin. It must have a positive fastening that will not come
undone, and a strong tunnel loop to hold it on your belt. Remember the pouch
contains matches, solid fuel and flares – all life-savers, but to be treated
with care.

## **Knives**

> **A knife is an invaluable asset in a survival situation.
The serious adventurer will carry one always. They should be packed with the
luggage that you are checking in when travelling by commercial aircraft,
otherwise they will be confiscated. Current knife law in the UK states that
knives where the blade folds into the handle are legal as long as the blade is
shorter than 3in (7.62cm).**

</div>
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">Watch Lofty show you how to handle a knife safely</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Choosing a knife

A multi-bladed folding knife is a useful tool, but, if you
carry only one knife, you need something stronger, a general-purpose blade that
will do all likely tasks efficiently and comfortably, from cutting trees to
skinning animals and preparing vegetables. Some have a compass built into the
handle or have the handle hollowed out so that you can carry survival kit
inside it. However, these features will be offset by the possibility of a
hollow handle breaking and a compass may soon lose its accuracy after the knife
has been used on a hardwood tree. If you lose this kind of knife you also lose
your survival kit – much better to keep the kit in a separate pouch on your belt or on the sheath.

:::tip[Remember: You are only as sharp as your knife]

Your knife is such an important piece of survival equipment,
that you must keep it sharp and ready for use. Don’t misuse your knife. Never
throw it into trees or onto the ground. Keep it clean and, if you don’t intend
to use it for a while, oiled and in its sheath.

When walking through close, or difficult terrain, get in
the habit of checking your knife. This should become an automatic reflex
especially after negotiating difficult terrain. A check of all pockets and
possessions should be second nature.

:::

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image016.webp" />

#### Folding knives

A folding knife that has a serrated edge, and which can be
opened one-handed is valuable, provided it has a good locked position. Always
carry one. A blade in a wooden handle is usually more comfortable: it will not
slip in a sweaty hand and, if the handle is made from a single piece of wood,
is less likely to cause blisters.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image017.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Handle (a) is ideal: a single rounded piece of wood, the knife
tang passing through it and fastened at the end. If the handle breaks the tang
can be wrapped with cloth or twine.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image018.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Handle (b) is only riveted to the tang and would cause
blisters. Handle (c) could break at the rivets if subjected to heavy work and

should have a positive fastening and a tunnel belt loop.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">

finer still for cawing and delicate work. (a) and (c) are easily maintained and
(b) is sharp but not so sharp as to chip easily.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Parang

This is the Malayan name for a type of knife with a large
curved blade like a machete. It is too large to be carried in normal daily life
but ideal when going out into the wild.

A parang 30cm (12in) in overall blade length and
weighing no more than 750g (1&frac34;lb) is best, the blade 5cm (2in) at its widest
and end-bolted into a wooden handle. The curved blade enables maximum effort to
be applied when cutting timber and the blade arrives before the knuckles, so
giving them protection. Even large trees can be cut down with a parang, which
is especially useful for building shelters and rafts.

#### Sharpening a knife

Any sandstone will sharpen tools – a grey, clayey
sandstone being best. Quartz, though more rarely found, is good and granite can
also be used. Rub two pieces together to make them smooth. A double-faced
stone with a rough and a smooth surface is ideal and should be carried in the
sheath pocket. Use the rough surface first to remove burrs, then the smooth one
to get a fine edge. The object is to get an edge that will last and not chip.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image020.webp" />

The sheath must have positive fastenings to keep the parang
secure, and a loop for fixing to a belt. Some sheaths have a pocket on the
front for a sharpening stone.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image021.webp" />

REMEMBER: There is a danger that the cutting edge may come
through the side. To draw the parang NEVER hold the sheath on the same side as
the cutting edge. This is dangerous. Get into the habit of gripping the side
AWAY FROM THE CUTTING EDGE.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image022.webp" />

To sharpen the blade, hold the handle in the right hand. Use a
clockwise circular motion and apply a steady pressure on the blade with the
fingertips of the left hand as you push away. Keep the angle constant and make
sure you push the knife into the stone so that the edge
is sharpened rather than rounded. Keep
the stone wet. Rock particles on the blade will show the angle you are
obtaining. DON’T drag the blade towards you under pressure. This will produce
burrs. Reduce the pressure for a finer edge. Work counter clockwise on the
other side.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image023.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Blade profile: (a) is too steep and will soon wear, (b) is
good and (c) is too fine and might chip.
</figcaption>
</figure>

## **Facing disaster**

> **When facing a disaster it is easy to let yourself go, to
collapse and be consumed in self-pity. But it is no use giving up or burying
your head and hoping this is a bad dream that will soon pass. It won’t, and
with that kind of attitude it will rapidly become much worse. Only positive
action can save you. A healthy, well-nourished person can physically tolerate a
great deal, provided that he or she has self-confidence. Even if sick or
injured, a determined person can win through and recover from seemingly
impossible situations. To do so there are many stresses that must be overcome.**

:::danger[Survival stress]

The survival situation will put you under pressure, both
physical and mental. You will have to overcome some or all of the following
stresses:

- Fear and anxiety
- Pain, illness and injury
- Cold and/or heat
- Thirst, hunger and fatigue
- Sleep deprivation
- Boredom
- Loneliness and isolation

Can you cope? You have to.

:::

Self-confidence is a product of good training and sound
knowledge. These must be acquired before you have to face up to a survival
situation.

Physical fitness plays an important part. The fitter
you are the better you will survive. Initially you may have to go without sleep
to find a safe location, or make a long march in dangerous conditions. Don’t
wait until you are forced to go without sleep to see if you are capable of
doing so. Prove it to yourself now by getting into training. Develop the
resources to cope with fatigue and loss of sleep.

You will be working hard to procure food and water.
They will relieve hunger and thirst. But finding them will tire you and you
will need an adequate shelter to enable you to rest and recover from your
efforts. Don’t overdo it. Rest frequently and assess the situation.

Pain and fever are warning signals that call
attention to an injury or physical condition. They are not in themselves
dangerous, however distressing and discomforting. Pain can be controlled and
overcome. Its biological function is to protect an injured part, to prevent you
using it, but this warning may have to be ignored to avoid the risk of further
injury or death.

### Basic needs

To reiterate, the main elements required for survival are
FOOD, FIRE, SHELTER and WATER. Use **PLAN**
(Protection, Location, Acquisition, Navigation) to help you to prioritise your
survival needs. If you don’t have shelter in the desert, having 2 litres
(3&frac12;pts) of water is of little use to you in the longer term.

It takes a healthy person quite a long time to die of
starvation, for the body can use up its stored resources, but exposure to wind,
rain and cold can be fatal even in temperate climates and death comes in only
minutes in the icy waters of the poles. Food is rarely the first priority. Even
in those places where it is difficult to find there are usually other problems
to face first. Shelter will often be the prime necessity in extremes of climate
or temperature – not just in the frozen polar regions or the baking deserts,
but for walkers trapped by mist on a hillside. The need for fire is closely
linked.

Water is something that most people in the modern world
take for granted. They are so used to turning on a tap that until an extreme
drought causes water rationing they scarcely think about it. Yet the survivor
at sea, or after a flood, though surrounded by water, may be desperate for
drinkable water – and there are many places where, unless it rains, no obvious
water is available. The other survival necessities are dealt with later in the
book, but water is universally important.

:::tip[Survival scenario]

How long can the body cope without essentials?

In general the human body can survive for 3 minutes
without air, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food. There are always
exceptions to this and there are examples of people pushing these boundaries
and surviving for longer periods. It is amazing what the human body can endure
but such a survivor’s health can suffer in the long term due to such trauma.
For example a person surviving for more than 9 days without water will
undoubtedly suffer kidney damage or failure.

:::

:::tip[Animals as signs of water]

MAMMALS  
Most animals require water regularly. Grazing animals are
usually never far from water – though some kinds travel thousands of miles to
avoid the dry season – as they need to drink at dawn and dusk. Converging game
trails often lead to water; follow them downhill. Carnivores (meat eaters) can
go for a long period between waterings. They get moisture from the animals on
which they prey so are not a positive indication of local water.

BIRDS  
Grain eaters, such as finches and pigeons, are never far from
water. They drink at dawn and dusk. When they fly straight and low they are
heading for water. When returning from water they are loaded with it and fly
from tree to tree, resting frequently. Plot their direction and water can be
found.

Water birds can travel long distances without stopping
to feed or drink so do not necessarily indicate water nearby. Hawks, eagles and
other birds of prey also get liquids from their victims so cannot be taken as a
sign of local water.

REPTILES  
Not an indicator of water. They collect dew and get moisture
from prey, so can go a long time without.

INSECTS  
Good indicators, especially bees: they fly at most 6.5km (4
miles) from their nests or hives, but have no regular watering times. Ants are
dependent upon water. A column of ants marching up a tree is going to a small
reservoir of trapped water. Such reservoirs are found even in arid areas.

Most flies keep within 90m (100yd) of water, especially
the European Mason Fly with its iridescent green body.

HUMAN TRACKS  
Will usually lead to a well, bore hole or soak. It may be
covered over with scrub or rocks to reduce evaporation. Replace the cover.

:::

## **Water**

> **Water is essential to life. A person can survive for
three weeks without food but for only three days without water, therefore its
discovery and conservation should be prioritized over food. Don’t wait until
you have run out of water before you look for it. Conserve what you have and
seek a source as soon as possible, preferably fresh running water, though all
water can be sterilized by boiling or by using chemical purifiers. In a
survival situation a 1 litre-jug (1&frac34;pt) can be made to last 4 days, but if
necessary the last &frac14; litre (&frac12;pt) can be made to last 3 days. This is achieved
by dividing the last &frac14; litre into
three, then drinking half of the day’s ration at midday, and the balance at
night, for 3 days.**
>
> **Water is the coolant that keeps the body at an even
temperature, it is needed to keep the kidneys functioning to eliminate wastes,
is required for breathing, and for digestion. But the fluids contained in the
body are limited. Lost water must be replaced or health and efficiency will
suffer. The average human requires the minimum of &frac14; litre (&frac12;pt) of water per
day to survive.**

#### Water loss

The average person loses 2–3 litres (3&frac12;–5&frac14;pt) of water
each day – even someone resting in shade loses about 1 litre (1&frac34;pt). Just
breathing loses fluids, and loss through respiration and perspiration increases
with work rate and temperature. Vomiting and diarrhoea increase loss further.
This must all be replaced to preserve the critical water balance, either by
actual water or water contained in food.

:::tip[How to retain fluids]

- Avoid exertion. Just rest.
- Don’t smoke.
- Keep cool. Stay in shade. If there is none, erect a cover
to provide it.
- Do not lie on hot ground or heated surfaces.
- Don’t eat, or eat as little as possible. If there is no
water available fluid will be taken from the vital organs to digest food,
further increasing dehydration. Fat is hardest to digest and takes a lot of
fluid to break it down.
- Never drink alcohol.
- Don’t talk – and breathe through the nose, not the mouth.

:::

### Finding water

The first place to look is in valley bottoms where water
naturally drains. If there is no obvious stream or pool, look for patches of
green vegetation and try digging there. There may be water just below the
surface which will build up in the hole. Even digging in gullies and dry stream
beds may reveal a spring beneath the surface, especially in gravelly areas. In
mountains look for water trapped in crevices.

On the coast digging above the high water line,
especially where there are sand-dunes, has a good chance of producing about 5cm
(2in) of fresh water that filters down and floats on the heavier salt water. It
may be brackish but is still drinkable. Where cliffs fall into the sea look for
lush growth of vegetation, even ferns and mosses, in a fault in the rock
formation and you may find a soak or spring.

If no fresh water can be found, salt water can be distilled
(see [Solar Still](#solar-still) and [Distillation](#distillation)).

#### Dew and rain collection

Despite the acid rain produced by industrialized countries,
which can cause a build-up of pollution in the soil, rainwater everywhere is
drinkable and only needs collecting. Use as big a catchment area as possible,
running the water off into containers of every kind. A hole dug in the ground
and lined with clay will hold water efficiently, but keep it covered. If you
have no impermeable sheeting, metal sheets or bark can be used to catch water
in. If you have any doubt about the water you have collected, boil it.

In climates where it is very hot during the day and
cold at night, heavy dew can be expected. When it condenses on metal objects it
can be sponged or licked off.

You can use clothing to soak up water and then wring it
out. One way is to tie clean cloths around the legs and ankles and walk through
wet vegetation. These can be sucked or wrung out.

**Remember**: ration your
sweat, not your water! If you have to ration water, take it in sips. After
going a long time without water, don’t guzzle when you do find it. Take only
sips at first. Large gulps will make a dehydrated person vomit, losing even
more of the valuable liquid.

### Condensation

Tree and plant roots draw moisture from the ground, but a
tree may take it from a water table 15m (50ft) or more below, too deep to dig
down to reach. Don’t try; let the tree pump it up for you by tying a plastic
bag around a leafy branch. Evaporation from the leaves will produce
condensation in the bag.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Ground sweatbag
</figcaption>
</figure>

Even cut vegetation will produce some condensation as it warms
up when placed in a large plastic bag. Arrange the bag on a slight slope to
encourage condensation to run down to the collecting point. When no longer
productive carefully replace with fresh foliage.

#### Solar still

Dig a hole in the ground approximately 90cm (36in) across and
45cm (18in) deep. Place a collecting can in the centre, then cover the hole
with a sheet of plastic formed into a cone. The sun’s heat raises the
temperature of the air and soil below and vapour is produced. As the air
becomes saturated, water condenses on the underside of the plastic, running
down into the container. This is especially effective in desert regions and
elsewhere when it is hot during the day and cold at night. The plastic cools
more quickly than the air, causing heavy condensation. This kind of still
should collect at least 570ml (1pt) over a 24-hour period.

The still may also double as a trap. Insects and
small snakes are attracted by the plastic. They may slide down into the cone or
wriggle underneath it and drop into the hole and then cannot climb out. A solar
still can be used to distill pure water from poisonous or contaminated liquids.

:::warning

Be suspicious of any pool with no green vegetation growing
around it, or animal bones present. It is likely to be polluted by chemicals in
the ground close to the surface. Check edge for minerals which might indicate
alkaline conditions. ALWAYS BOIL WATER FROM POOLS. In deserts there are lakes
with no outlets; these become salt lakes. Their water MUST be distilled before
drinking.

:::

#### Distillation

Distillation kits are part of the equipment of life-rafts,
but they can be improvised. To distill liquid you need to make something to do
the job of a laboratory retort. Pass a tube into the top of a water-filled
covered container, placed over a fire, and the other end into a sealed
collecting tin which, preferably, is set inside another container providing a
jacket of cold water to cool the vapour as it passes out of the tube. You can
improvise the equipment from any tubing – pack frames, for instance. To avoid
wasting water vapour, seal around the joins with mud or wet sand.

An easier method is a variation on the solar still.
It takes a little longer for the water to condense but may be easier to set up.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">

#### Water from ice and snow

Melt ice rather than snow – it produces a greater volume
faster for less heat: twice as much for half the heat. If forced to heat snow,
place a little in the pot and melt that first, gradually adding more to it. If
you put a lot of snow into the pot, the lower level will melt and then be
soaked up into the absorbent snow above it, leaving a hollow beneath which will
make the pot burn. Lower layers of snow are more granular than that on the
surface and will yield more water.

#### Water from sea ice

Sea ice is salt (no good for drinking) until it has aged. The
more recently frozen, the saltier it will be. New sea ice is rough in contour
and milky-white in colour. Old ice is bluish and has rounded edges, caused by
weathering.

Good water can be obtained from blue ice – the bluer
and smoother the better. But beware of even old ice that has been exposed to
salt spray.

:::warning

URINE AND SEA WATER  
Never drink either – Never! But both can produce drinking water
if distilled – and sea water will provide you with a residue of salt.

:::

### Water from plants

#### Water collectors

Cup-shaped plants and cavities between the leaves of
bromeliads (many of which are parasitic on the branches of tropical trees)
often collect a reservoir of water.

Bamboo often holds water in its hollow joints. Old
and yellow stems are more likely to be water-bearing. Shake them – if you can
hear water slurping around, cut a notch at the bottom of each joint and tip the
water out.

#### Vines

Vines with rough bark and shoots about 5cm (2in) thick can be
a useful source of water. But you must learn by experience which are the
water-bearing vines, because not all have drinkable water and some have a
poisonous sap. The poisonous ones yield a sticky, milky sap when cut. You will
know not to try that type again – otherwise it is a matter of trial and error
and worth trying any species.

Some vines cause a skin irritation on contact if you
suck them, so it is better to let the liquid drip into your mouth rather than
put your mouth to the stem, and preferable to collect it in a container.

To obtain water from a vine select a particular stem
and trace it upwards. Reach as high as possible and cut a deep notch in the
stem. Cut off the same stem close to the ground and let the water drip from it
into your mouth or into a container. When it ceases to drip, cut a section from
the bottom and go on repeating this until the vine is drained. Do NOT cut the
bottom of the vine first as this will cause the liquid to run up the vine
through capillary action.

#### Roots

In Australia the water tree, desert oak and bloodwood have
their roots near the surface. Prise these roots out from the ground and cut
them up into 30cm (12in) lengths. Remove the bark. Suck out the moisture, or
shave to a pulp and squeeze over the mouth.

It is not easy to find some of the most useful
desert roots unless you have been shown by someone with experience. Australian
Aborigines can identify a tiny twig which grows from a football-like bulbous
root, which can be a life-saver – but unless you have been shown how to find
them it is not worth expending your energy and resources looking.

#### Cacti

Both the fruit and bodies of cacti store water, but not all
cacti produce liquid safe to drink – the Saquarro, the giant multi-fingered
cactus of Arizona, is very poisonous. Take care to avoid contact with cactus
spines, they can be very difficult to remove, especially the very fine,
hair-like ones, and can cause festering sores if they stay in the skin.

The barrel cactus Echinocactus grusoni (see
[_Desert Plants_](/sas-urban/placeholder-desert-plants)) can reach a height
of 120cm (4ft), is found in the southern United States through to South America
and requires considerable effort to cut through its tough, spine-covered outer
skin. The best method is to cut off the top and chop out pieces from the inside
to suck, or to smash the pulp within the plant and scoop out the watery sap,
which varies from tasteless in some plants to bitter in others.

An average-sized, 100cm (3&frac14;ft) barrel cactus will
yield about 1 litre (1&frac34;pt) of milky juice and this is an exception to the rule
to avoid milky-sapped plants.

</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Palms

The buri, coconut and nipa palms all contain a sugary fluid
which is very drinkable. To start it flowing bend a flowering stalk downwards
and cut off its tip. If a thin slice is cut off the stalk every 12 hours the
flow will be renewed, making it possible to collect up to a quart each day.
Nipa palms shoot from the base so that you can work from ground level; on grown
trees of other species you may have to climb up them to reach a flowering stalk.

Coconut milk has considerable water content, but
from ripe nuts it is a powerful laxative; drinking too much would make you lose
more fluid.

Traveller’s Tree Ravenala madagascariensis, one of the banana
family, can hold 1–2 litres (2–4pt) of water between the bases of the chevron

</figcaption>
</figure>

### Water from animals

Animal eyes contain water which can be extracted by sucking
them.

All fish contain a drinkable fluid. Large fish, in
particular, having a reservoir of fresh water along the spine. Tap it by gutting
the fish and, keeping the fish flat, remove the backbone, being careful not to
spill the liquid, and then drink it.

If you need water that badly you should be careful not
to suck up the other fish juices in the flesh, for they are rich in protein and
will use up water in digestion.

Desert animals can also be a source of moisture. In
times of drought in north-western Australia, Aborigines dig in dry clay pans
for the desert frogs that burrow in the clay to keep cool and survive. They
store water in their bodies and it can be squeezed out of them.

## **Salt**

> **Salt is essential for water retention. A normal diet
includes a daily intake of 10g (1/3oz). The trouble starts when you start to
get rid of it faster than you eat it. The body loses salt in sweat and urine,
so the warmer the climate the greater the loss. Physical exertion will also
increase the loss. However, replenishing the salt levels in your body is not
always recommended, and much will depend on the situation you find yourself in.
If you are on reduced food and or water rations, salt is the first thing that
should be cut from your diet, because it increases dehydration.**

What happens if you do not carry salt or your supplies run
out? By the coast or at sea there is plenty of saltwater available – a pint of
sea water contains about 15g (&frac12;oz) of salt, but do NOT just drink it as it is.
Dilute it with plenty of fresh water. Evaporating sea water will leave you with
salt crystals.

Inland salt supplies are more problematic. In farming
areas you will find salt licks for cattle – but you will then be close to
civilization and not likely to have reached the stage of salt deprivation.
However, all animals need salt, and observation of them may reveal a natural
source. In one part of Africa elephants risk the dangerous depths of a dark
cave to lick salt from its sides.

Salt can be obtained from some plants. In North America
the best source is the roots of hickory trees, and in south-east Asia those of
the nipa palm can be used in the same way. Boil the roots until all the water
is evaporated and black salt crystals are left.

If no direct salt sources are available to you then
you will have to rely on getting it second-hand, through animal blood, which
should never be wasted as it is a valuable source of minerals.

:::danger[Recognize the signs of dehydration]

The first symptoms of salt deficiency are muscle cramps,
dizziness, nausea and tiredness. The remedy is to take a pinch of salt in half
a litre (&frac34; pint) of water. Salt supplements in tablet form used to be the
prescribed method of increasing sodium levels but always dissolve these in
water, or isotonic drinks – if they are available.

:::

## **Reading the signs**

> **Being able to read and make a map is only the beginning
of being able to find your way about. You must learn to interpret the signs
found on the ground itself and in the air.**
>
> **If you do not have a compass, there are a number of ways
of creating your own. The sun and stars can provide firm orientation – a
variety of methods are available for finding direction in both northern and
southern hemispheres.**
>
> **An ability to anticipate the weather can also be a
valuable asset in the wild and simple guidelines for prediction and the
interpretation of cloud patterns equip the survivor with more skills.**

Before embarking on any expedition you will have learned all
you can about the terrain, equipped yourself with maps, if available, and
worked out routes. Memorize the lie of the land, the direction in which rivers
flow, the high ground, the prominent features, the prevailing winds, the weather
patterns to expect and any known hazards, check the phase of the moon and times
of first and last light – all of which will be invaluable knowledge if you find
yourself in difficulties. In a case of accident you may find yourself in a
totally unknown territory and have to find out everything about your location
from the land itself.

In choosing a campsite, tracing water and finding
the other necessities for survival you will need to interpret the surrounding
countryside – the other side of a hill may offer quite different conditions –
and if you decide not to stay put you will have to interpret both the general
geography and the particular landscape as you proceed.

### Maps

Choose maps carefully, making sure that they are to a
scale that will be useful to you and show helpful information. A very
large-scale map that shows every footpath and building will be no use at all if
you are driving a thousand miles along a motorway. Everything will be shown in
great detail but only a tiny fraction of the journey will appear on one sheet
and you would have to pile the car with maps and change from one to another
every few miles. On the other hand few motoring maps give much information
about the nature of the terrain or show features which would help a walker
choose their route. Sailors must be equipped with accurate charts so that they
can keep to safe waters. The surface below the sea can be as varied as that
above. Flyers will need to know what altitude obstructions are and what
turbulences occur near mountains which make it safer to fly higher. From the
air the pattern of the land may show plainly but its contours are flattened
out; without interpretation, a map looks rather like that to many people.

#### Maps and terrain

Height cannot be reproduced on flat sheets of paper so
altitudes are recorded at regular intervals (usually every 50ft or every 15m
according to the measure used) and every point at this height is joined up by a
line – the contour line. In most cases these lines join up to form a complete
shape, some sort of irregular oval with bulges here and there. If they suddenly
stop against another line that means that there is an abrupt change of height –
in fact, a cliff or a very steep fall.

The only contour line that you can see in nature is
that of sea level along the coast (and even that is not quite true because of
tidal variation) but you can imagine the contour lines as the edges of flat
disks and that these are ranged equidistantly above each other. If you threw a
cloth to rest over them it would link them together in a shape that would be
approximately like a hill or other feature. However, you do not have a record
of exactly what happens between those contour lines and there will not
necessarily be an even slope connecting them. There could be outcrops of rock,
hollows – any manner of variation within that 15m or 50ft. From the relative
positions of one height to another you could make a pretty good guess as to
what the ground surface was like, but you could not be sure. There may
therefore be features that, because they fall between the contour lines, make
no appearance on your map.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image044.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
When the contours are closely grouped the change in height is
more rapid (a). Conversely, greater spaces between the contour lines indicate
gentler slopes (b).
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Interpreting maps

Remember that the intervals between the contour lines are the
distances between horizontal points at the same theoretical height – not the
actual distance on the slope of the ground. They are measured in units that
show relative positions and are not to a scale as is the horizontal plotting.

It is a common error to think of a group of contour
lines indicating a rise in the ground comparable to the scale of the distance
shown between them – but the scale of a typical walkers’ map is 1:50,000 and
10m on that would be only .02mm. Contours spaced 5mm apart on the surface of
the map would be at a horizontal distances of 250m and the gradient only 1 in
25.

#### Scale

Before you can begin to use a map you must understand its
scale. This may be shown by a scale bar marked with miles or kilometres to the
size that they are shown on the map or it may be given as a ratio – 1:50,000
means that every measure on the map represents a distance 50,000 times greater
on the ground.

#### Key

There will usually also be a key to the symbols used within
the map to represent natural and manmade features – rivers, roads, buildings,
types of woodland or swamps, types of beach. What is shown, and how, will vary
greatly. If there is no key on the individual map or on its wrapping make sure
that you find out what symbols mean in that map series. Some will be fairly
evident: if the map is in colour rivers will almost certainly be in blue,
marshes will usually be indicated by stylized tufts of reed.

Not all features can be shown to exact scale. Roads
and paths will probably be given standard widths to match the kind of track
they are rather than their exact measurements, and streams and rivers will be
similarly standardized. The British Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, for instance,
show waterways as a single blue line, gradually increasing in width until it
represents a width of 8m (27ft) across a stream, whereupon a double line is
used, giving you an immediate indication that you have a river at least that
wide to cross. There are similar standardizations on all maps. Once you have
mastered the way that information is shown, maps will tell you a great deal.

#### Grids

Maps almost always carry a grid of lines which divides
them up. This is either based on degrees of latitude and longitude or a special
grid developed by the mapping authority. The advantage of the special grids is
that they are usually planned to form squares based on ground measurement which
can help you rapidly assess distances. On the British OS maps, for instance,
the grid lines are 1km apart and the diagonal across them is 1&frac12;km. If you want
to find, or report, a position it can be described by a coordinate made up from
the line references from two adjoining sides of the map. To anyone using a map
with the same grid this will immediately locate the ‘box’ in which it appears.
Dividing the square by eye into further tenths pinpoints the location. This
provides an easy way of telling rescuers of your location or of fixing a
rendezvous point with them.

#### North on maps

Unless they are lines of longitude, the grid lines on a map
are not an indication of north and south, though they may sometimes be close to
it. Remember that a compass points not to true north but to magnetic north –
and the difference between the two varies both according to where you are in
the world and because magnetic north is slowly changing its position. To take
accurate bearings you need to know these variations, but even a rough idea of
orientation will help you to match your map to the landscape.

If you have an adjustable compass and information on
the deviation of it and of your map grid from true north you can carefully
match up all of them so that even in poor visibility, or where landscape
features are beyond your horizon, you can take accurate bearings and follow
them.

Many maps indicate the deviation or the direction of
magnetic north. If this is not given you can find it from the North Star or by
using the watch method to point to north. Use the Southern Cross in the same
way in the Southern Hemisphere to establish south (both are illustrated later).

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image045.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
The point marked with a dot can be described as 15.5 x 62.8
using the coordinates from the sides of this grid. This system requires that
squares are mentally divided into tenths in each direction. The ‘map reference’
is normally expressed as six digits: 155628. Any letter area codes on the map
should be included.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Local magnetic variation

To find the local magnetic variation, when not recorded on a
map, point the compass at the North Star. Note the difference between the
pointer and indicated north.

Lining the compass up with the grid lines on the map
you can discover their variation, if there is one. If you then propose to walk
on magnetic bearings you must remember to compensate for the variation.

Map-reading skills should be learned by anyone planning
an expedition and are particularly important in mountainous country. Compasses are
available mounted with calibrations, scales and direction markers which make
this kind of orientation easier. Check them out and have them explained to you.

In a survival situation you will probably have to
manage without such sophistication. If unable to make appropriate corrections,
continually check your position against visible features.

#### Measuring distances

As-the-crow-flies distances can be measured by using any
straight edge and matching it up against the scale bar or multiplying by the
ratio of the map’s scale. Meandering routes can be followed with a piece of
thread which can then be straightened out. Gradients can make an appreciable
difference to distances and must be allowed for – a gradient of 45 degrees, for
instance, will add another 82m to a horizontal map distance of 200m (328ft
becomes 725ft).

:::tip[Survival scenario]

You are navigating your way across unfamiliar terrain –
what’s the most important thing to watch out for?

One of the most common errors people make is to
overestimate how much ground they have covered. It is usually much less. One
way around this is to fit the ground where you are to the map rather than the
map to where you think you are.

:::

#### Your own maps

The survivor may not be lucky enough to have a map and should
then set about making one. With a map you will always be able to find your way
back to camp – essential if you are going for help for the sick, children or
elderly survivors left behind.

It is not possible for you to measure exact contour
heights, but you can devise your own system for indicating the contours.

Find the best vantage point and look out over the
terrain. Climbing a tree may give a better view. Note the direction of the
ridges, count how many you can see. Between each ridge there is probably a
stream or river flowing, you cannot be sure – there will be a lot of ‘dead
ground’, territory you cannot see. Make a general map with blank patches and
then fill them in as you gain more information from other vantage points and
from your explorations on the ground.

Mark anything of interest on your map: watercourses,
rocky outcrops, isolated trees, strangely shaped features that will act as
landmarks, and areas of different vegetation. You can plot positions of your
traps, animal lairs, good places for foraging for food and fuel or finding
useful stones for implements. It will be much easier for you or your companions
than relying on your memory or vague descriptions.

### Direction finding

The Earth’s relationship to the rest of the solar system and
the position of the stars in the sky help to locate any position on its
surface. Its revolution on its axis produces the changes from light to darkness
and its orbit around the sun produces the seasons, for the earth is tilted at
an angle to the sun and first the north and then the south becomes nearer to
it, the closest point traversing from the Tropic of Cancer (23.5&deg;N) to the
Tropic of Capricorn (23.5&deg;S), the sun being above Cancer on 22 June and above
Capricorn on 22 December. It is above the Equator on 21 March and 21 September.

The sun rises in the east and sets in the west – but
not EXACTLY in the east and west. There is also some seasonal variation. In the
Northern Hemisphere, when at its highest point in the sky, the sun will be due
south; in the Southern Hemisphere this noonday point will mark due north. The
hemisphere will be indicated by the way that shadows move: clockwise in the
north, anticlockwise in the south. Shadows can be a guide to both direction and
time of day.

#### Shadow stick method #1

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image048.webp" />

</figure>

#### Shadow stick method #2

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image052.webp" />

Another, more accurate, method – if you have the time – is to
mark the first shadow tip in the morning. Draw a clean arc at exactly this
distance from the stick, using the stick as a centre point. As midday
approaches the shadow will shrink and move. In the afternoon, as the shadow
lengthens again, mark the EXACT spot where it touches the arc. Join the two
points to give east and west – west is the morning mark.

#### Direction by watch

A traditional watch with two hands can be used to find
direction, provided it is set to true local time (without variation for summer
daylight saving and ignoring conventional time zones which do not match real
time). The nearer the Equator you are the less accurate this method will be,
for with the sun almost directly overhead it is very difficult to determine its
direction.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
If you have a power source of two volts or more (a small dry
battery, for instance) the current can be used to magnetize the metal. You will
also need a short length of wire, preferably insulated. Coil the insulated wire
around the ‘needle’. If it has no ready-made insulation wrap a few layers of
paper or a piece of cardboard around the needle first. Attach the ends of the
wire to the terminals of the battery for five minutes.

</figcaption>
</figure>

Use other methods to establish which general direction is
north and then identify which end of your new compass needle is which and mark
one of them. Top up your needle’s magnetism from time to time, and always check
your reading with the sun. A ‘wild’ reading may be given if large amounts of
ferrous metal are nearby.

#### Plant pointers

Even without a compass or the sun to give direction you can
get an indication of north and south from plants. They tend to grow towards the
sun so their flowers and most abundant growth will be to the south in the
Northern Hemisphere, the north in the South.

On tree trunks moss will tend to be greener and more
profuse on that side too (on the other side it will be yellowish to brown).
Trees with a grainy bark will also display a tighter grain on the north side of
the trunk.

If trees have been felled or struck down the pattern of
the rings on the stump also indicates direction – more growth is made on the side
towards the Equator so there the rings are more widely spaced.

There are even species of plant known for their
north–south orientation:

#### The wind direction

If the wind direction of the prevailing wind is known it can
be used for maintaining direction – there are consistent patterns throughout
the world but they are not always the same the whole year round.

Where a strong wind always comes from the same
direction plants and trees may be bent in one direction, clear evidence of the
wind’s orientation. But plants are not the only indication of wind direction:
birds and insects will usually build their nests in the lee of any cover and
spiders cannot spin their webs in the wind. Snow and sand dunes are also blown
into distinctive patterns by a prevailing wind which blows from the outside of
the high central ridges.

#### Making use of the moon

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image064.webp" />

The moon has no light of its own, it reflects that of the
sun. As it orbits the earth over 28 days the shape of the light reflected
varies according to its position. When the moon is on the same side of the
earth as the sun no light is visible – this is the ‘new moon’ (a) – then it
reflects light from its apparent right-hand side, from a gradually increasing
area as it ‘waxes’. At the full moon it is on the opposite side of the earth
from the sun (b) and then it ‘wanes’, the reflecting area gradually reducing to
a narrow sliver on the apparent left-hand side. This can be used to identify
direction.

If the moon rises BEFORE the sun has set the
illuminated side will be on the west. If the moon rises AFTER midnight the
illuminated side will be in the east. This may seem a little obvious, but it
does mean you have the moon as a rough east-west reference during the night.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">How to navigate by the stars in both the Northern and Southern hemipheres</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Direction by the stars

The stars stay in the same relation to one another and pass
over the same places on the earth night after night. Their passage over the
horizon starts four minutes earlier each night – a two-hour difference in time
over a month. If you study a star at a certain position at a certain time one
evening and then check its position the next evening at the same time you will
find that it has moved one degree of arc anticlockwise in the northern
hemisphere, clockwise in the southern. Rising in the east, stars attain a
zenith and set on the western horizon at the same distance from their zenith as
they rose.

The stars have been studied for thousands of years and
the groups, or constellations, in which they appear to the naked eye were named
in ancient times after the animals and mythological figures that their shape
suggested.

In the northern hemisphere there are groups of stars
that remain visible throughout the night, wheeling around the only star that
does not appear to move – the Pole Star (a valuable navigation aid, for it is
located almost above polar north). In the southern hemisphere the Pole Star is
not visible and there is no comparable bright and stable southern star, but
direction finding in the southern hemisphere makes use of a constellation
called the Southern Cross, in a way that is explained later.

#### The northern sky

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/Night_Nav_Northern_1.webp" />

The main constellations to learn are the Plough, also known
as the Big Dipper (diagram ‘a’, opposite), Cassiopeia (diagram ‘b’, opposite)
and Orion, all of which, like all stars in the northern sky, apparently circle
the Pole Star (Polaris), but the first two are recognizable groups that do not
set.

These constellations come up at different times according
to latitude and Orion is most useful if you are near the Equator.

Each can be used in some way to check the position of
the Pole Star (North Star) but once you have learned to recognize it you
probably will not need to check each time.

A line can be drawn connecting Cassiopeia and the
Plough (the Big Dipper), through the Pole Star. You will notice that the two
lowest stars of the Great Bear point almost to the Pole Star. It will help you
to find these constellations if you look along the Milky Way.

exactly to the Pole Star about four times further away than the distance
between them.

find this constellation as a guide to the location of the Pole Star, if the
Plough is obscured for some reason. The centre star points almost directly
towards it.
</figcaption>

#### Info

Apparently rising = facing **east**

Apparently falling = facing **west**

Looping flatly to the right = facing **south**

Looping flatly to the left = facing **north**

These are only approximate directions but you will
find them adequate for navigation. They will be reversed in the southern
hemisphere.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image068.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Other stars that rise and set can be used to determine
direction. Set two stakes in the ground, one shorter than the other, so that
you can sight along them (or use the sights of a rifle propped in a steady
position). Looking along them at any star – except the Pole Star – it will
appear to move. From the star’s apparent movement you can deduce the direction
in which you are facing.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Reading the southern sky

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/Night_Nav_Southern_1.webp" />

There is no star near the South Celestial Pole bright
enough to be easily recognized. Instead a prominent constellation is used as a
signpost to south: the Southern Cross (Crux), a constellation of five stars
which can be distinguished from two other cross-shaped groups by its size – it
is smaller – and its two pointer stars.

#### Finding south

To locate south, project an imaginary line along the cross and
four and a half times longer and then drop it vertically down to the horizon.
Fix, if you can, a prominent landmark on the horizon – or drive two sticks into
the ground to enable you to remember the position by day.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/Night_Nav_Southern_1.webp" />

#### Finding the southern cross

One way to find the Southern Cross is to look along the
Milky Way, the band of millions of distant stars that can be seen running
across the sky on a clear night. In the middle of it there is a dark patch
where a cloud of dust blocks out the bright star background, known as the Coal
Sack. On one side of it is the Southern Cross, on the other the two bright
pointer stars.

### Weather signs

Weather is much more localized than climate. Although it is
possible to generalize about the weather to be expected in different parts of
the world, and in some territories weather patterns are very stable, the
geography of one small area may make it differ considerably from that
adjoining.

Weather patterns are produced partly by the broad
movements of wind and water over the whole globe and partly by localized
differences in temperature and air pressure which cause air movements. These
produce winds and carry rain.

In general, air moves from high-pressure areas into
low-pressure zones, with warm air expanding and rising, cooler air moving in
underneath. The warm air takes up moisture but at higher altitudes, or when
some other cause brings down its temperature, the moisture begins to condense
as cloud and eventually will fall as rain.

The most obvious example is where mountains force air
currents upwards, rain falling on the slopes. In some places so much water is
lost that on the far side of the range there is a dry ‘rain shadow’ territory.

However, that does not necessarily mean that if,
from the dry terrain, you climb and cross the ridge you will move into a
well-watered zone. The mountain zone may continue some way before the area of
great precipitation is reached, or some earlier physical feature may have
caused clouds to shed most of their rain.

#### Coastal areas

In coastal areas, whether of an ocean or an inland sea or
lake, there will usually be a wind pattern that reverses from day to night.
Water absorbs and loses heat less readily than the land and consequently it
tends to be cooler than land during the day and warmer at night. The
temperature difference affects the air above it and during the day breezes
usually blow from sea to land, at night the wind changes and blows off the
land.

Where an island is close to a large land mass these
patterns may be overlaid by a broader air movement but a very regular pattern
of day-night change in wind direction suggests a large body of water in the
direction from which the day wind blows.

#### Winds

Winds can carry scents with them, providing information about
the place from which they blow. Even to the untrained nose the smell of the sea
will be recognizable, and to the shipwrecked survivor the smells of vegetation
will indicate the direction of land. However, do not rely entirely on the nose,
use other evidence to confirm its message.

Where winds tend to maintain direction they can be an
aid in keeping to a course, but some other check should also be regularly made
to keep direction.

Study the direction of the wind and the accompanying
weather. Make a note of them. Dependent always upon barometric conditions, wind
from a certain direction is always likely to bring a similar kind of weather.
It is a guide for weather prediction.

If a wind is strong and dry the weather will remain
constant until the wind drops or veers, then it may rain.

If it is foggy and misty you may get condensation but
you will not get rain – but if a wind rises and blows away the fog it may turn
to rain.

On a fine day a noticeable increase in the strength
of the wind indicates a weather change. (See also
[_Hurricane_](/sas-urban/placeholder-hurricane) and
[_Tornado_](/sas-urban/placeholder-tornado).)

patterns.

### Clouds

Watch the way that clouds change, for clouds are the most
reliable of weather signs.

Clouds are formed from masses of water vapour which
becomes visible as it condenses with cooling. If cooling continues the droplets
increase in size until, too heavy to remain airborne, they fall as rain. When
their temperature rises sufficiently they evaporate and the cloud disperses.

There are ten main types of cloud formation.
Approximate altitudes are given for each type. The same shapes occur at lower
altitudes in polar regions.

The higher the clouds the finer the weather.

Small black clouds scudding beneath a dark stratus
layer often bring showers.

Clouds hanging on high ground indicate rain, unless
they move by midday.

### Predictions

To be caught in bad weather could be fatal to survival. There
is a time to go out or move on and a time to shelter. With an awareness of
certain signs, short-term weather predictions can be made to help decide which
to do.

Before setting out on any activity take note of the
weather and any changes that are likely. Learn to observe all wind and pressure
changes and keep a record of the weather and the conditions which precede it
and what they develop into.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image081.webp" />

#### Wildlife indicators

Animals have great sensitivity to atmospheric pressure which aids
them in forecasting the weather a day or two in advance.

Insect-eating birds, such as swallows, feed higher in
good weather, lower when a storm is approaching.

Unusual rabbit activity during the day, or squirrels
taking more food than usual to the nest, may be a prelude to bad weather.

Nature, however, does not go in for long-time
forecasting. A squirrel’s hoard of nuts is an indication of its industry, not
the intensity of the coming winter. The depth of a bear’s den has no relation
to its severity, but reflects the soil conditions. A particularly big crop of
berries is the result of previous bad conditions, the tree producing extra
fruit to give the species more chance of survival.

#### Fireside clues

If the smoke from the camp fire rises steadily the weather is
settled and likely to remain fine. If it starts swirling, or being beaten
downwards after rising a short way, it indicates the likely approach of a storm
or shower.

Wooden tool handles tighten at the approach of
stormy weather. Salt picks up increasing dampness in the air and will not run.

#### ‘Feelings in your bones’

Curly-haired people find their hair becomes tighter and
less manageable as bad weather approaches – and the same happens to animal fur.
Anyone with rheumatism, corns or similar ailments can usually tell when wet
weather is coming by an increase in their discomfort.

#### Sound and smell

When wet weather is on the way sounds tend to carry further
than usual and distant noises seem more clear – the moisture-laden atmosphere
acts like an amplifier. But compare like to like – remember, sound always
travels better over water.

The smell of trees and plants becomes more
distinctive before the arrival of rain, the vegetation is opening ready to
receive it.

#### Signs in the sky

‘Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight, red sky in the
morning, shepherd’s warning’ is one of the oldest of weather sayings. Since a
red sun, or a red sky at sunset, indicates that the atmosphere holds little
moisture it is unlikely that rain or snow will occur within the next two hours,
but equally a red sky in the morning is a fair indication that a storm is
approaching.

A grey morning is usually the start of a dry day. The
dull colour is the result of dry air above the haze formed by the collection of
dew on the dust particles suspended in the lower atmosphere.

An evening sky that is grey and overcast indicates rain
– the dust particles are so laden with moisture that they will soon drop as
rain.

In hilly country, if mist has not lifted by noon, it is
set in for the day and will probably turn to rain during the late afternoon.

A clear night sky is an indication of good, settled
weather. At the end of summer it may also be a warning of frost: at night
clouds insulate the surface of the earth against loss of heat. Without them
frost is more likely. Cold air, being heavy, fills the hollows – avoid camping
in them.

A clear sky one night, followed by one with only a few
stars visible, indicates a change of weather.

A corona, a coloured circle visible around the sun or
moon, can be used to forecast the weather accurately. An enlarging ring is a
sign of good weather – the enlarging circle shows that moisture in the
atmosphere is evaporating and day or night will be clear.

A shrinking corona around the sun or moon is a sign of
rain.

Green light blinking from an afternoon sun indicates
fair weather for at least 24 hours.

## **Fire**

> **Fire can be the difference between life and death. It is
imperative that you are able to light a fire under any conditions, anywhere in
the world. The most important uses of fire are for boiling water, signalling,
cooking, and protection from animals and flying insects.**

<figure>
<div className="ratio ratio-16x9">

</div>
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">Learn effective fire building techniques</figcaption>
</figure>

Because 90 per cent of the
diseases that are carried in water can be countered by boiling water it is
vital that you learn the skill of firelighting. However, you don’t need to boil
rainwater, as it won’t carry any of the bacteria found in the other water
sources that you will encounter.

Fire can help to make or fashion tools (you can
fire-harden bamboo to make a spoon), while charcoal can be used to burn out a
hole. This can be safer than cutting the hole yourself which could lead to you
injuring yourself.

When lighting a fire, always ensure adequate
ventilation, with enough fuel and a hot enough source to ignite this fuel. To
produce flame, this temperature must be maintained to keep air and fuel
continuously reacting. The more oxygen introduced, the brighter the fire: by
using the wind, or forcing a draught, the fire is fanned to a high temperature
and rapidly burns fuel. By reducing the ventilation the fire burns less
fiercely and embers are allowed to glow, needing less fuel.

If these principles are understood, smoky fires can
be avoided. Smoke is the result of incomplete combustion – with care smoke can
be virtually eliminated.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image084.webp" />

</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Preparation

First make sure that you have sufficient quantities of
TINDER, KINDLING and FUEL. Then prepare a fireplace so that you can control the
fire. Used carelessly fire can get out of hand and bring disaster.

#### The fireplace

The fireplace needs to be prepared carefully. Choose a site
that is sheltered, especially during high winds. Except for signal purposes
(see [Signalling](#signalling)), or exceptionally to warm a temporary
bough or snowhole shelter, do not light a fire at the base of a tree or stump.
Clear away leaves, twigs, moss and dry grass from a circle at least 2m (6ft)
across and scrape everything away until you have a surface of bare earth.

If the ground is wet or covered with snow, the fire
must be built on a platform. Make this from a layer of green logs covered with
a layer of earth or a layer of stones.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image086.webp" />

#### Temple fire

If land is swampy or the snow deep a raised platform is
needed. This is known as a temple fire. The hearth consists of a raised
platform, built of green timber. Four uprights support cross-pieces in their
forks. Across them place a layer of green logs and cover this with several
inches of earth. Light the fire on top of this. A pole across upper forks on
diagonally opposite uprights can support cooking pots.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image087.webp" />

:::tip[Practice firelighting]

Fire is essential to survival. It provides warmth,
protection, a means of signalling, boils water, and cooks and preserves food.
You must learn to light a fire anywhere under any condition. It is not enough
to know all the methods – you have to be expert at them.

:::

#### In windy conditions

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image088.webp" />

If there are particularly strong winds, dig a trench and light
your fire in it.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image089.webp" />

Also good for windy conditions: Encircle your fire with rocks
to retain heat and conserve fuel. Use them to support cooking utensils. Their
heat, as well as that from the fire, will keep things warm and you can use the
rocks themselves as bed-warmers.

:::danger

Avoid placing wet or porous rocks and stones near fires,
especially rocks which have been submerged in water – they may explode when
heated. Avoid slates and softer rocks, and test others by banging them
together. Do not use any that crack, sound hollow or are flaky. If they contain
moisture it will expand faster than the stone and can make it explode,
producing dangerous flying fragments which could take out an eye if you are
close to the fire.

:::

#### Tinder

Tinder is any kind of material that takes the minimum of heat
to make it catch alight. Good tinder needs only a spark to ignite it.

Birch bark, dried grasses, fine wood shavings, bird
down, waxed paper and cotton fluff from clothing all make good tinder. So do
pulverized fir cones, pine needles and the inner bark from cedar trees. Dried
fungi are excellent, if finely powdered, and scorched or charred cotton or
linen, especially ground finely, are also among the best. Where insects such as
wood wasps have been boring into trees, the fine dust they produce is good
tinder and powdery bird and bat droppings can also be used. The insides of
birds’ nests are usually lined with down feathers and ignite easily – dry
fieldmouse nests are also usable.

Whatever tinder you use MUST BE DRY. It is a good
idea to carry tinder with you in a waterproof container. Always keep an eye
open for tinder to collect.

#### Kindling

Kindling is the wood used to raise the flames from the tinder
so that larger and less combustible materials can be burned.

The best kindling consists of small, dry twigs and the
softer woods are preferable because they flare up quickly.

Those that contain resins burn readily and make
firelighting a snip. The drawbacks of soft woods are that they tend to produce
sparks and burn very fast. You may need more to get the main fuel going and
they are soon consumed if they form the main fuel themselves.

Don’t collect kindling straight from the earth, it
is almost always damp. Take it from standing deadwood. If the outside is damp,
shave until the dry middle is reached.

</figcaption>
</figure>

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/Fire_Feeding_18.webp" />

### Fuel

Use dry wood from standing trees to get the fire going. Once
it is established you can use greener wood or dry out damp wood.

As a general rule, the heavier the wood the more heat
it will give – this applies to both dead and green wood. Mixing green and dry
wood makes a long-lasting fire, which is especially useful at night.

**Hardwoods** – hickory,
beech or oak, for instance – burn well, give off great heat and last for a long
time as hot coals. They keep a fire going through the night.

**Softwoods** tend to burn
too fast and give off sparks. The worst spark-makers are cedar, alder, hemlock,
spruce, pine, chestnut and willow.

**Remember** that damp
wood is sometimes advantageous, producing smoke to keep off flies, midges and
mosquitoes and burning longer so that it keeps the fire in.

#### Save energy

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image103.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Don’t waste energy chopping logs: Break them by smashing them

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">

</figcaption>
</figure>

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image105.webp" />

If it is absolutely necessary to split logs in order to
conserve fuel, an axe is not needed. Even quite a small knife placed on the end
of a log and hit with a rock may split it (c). Once begun, plug a wooden wedge
in the opened gap and drive this downwards to complete the split. But if you
only have one knife don’t take the risk of damaging it.

#### Star fire

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image108.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
The fire is started where the ends of large logs meet, then
they are pushed inwards as more fuel is needed.
</figcaption>
</figure>

When not required to produce strong heat they can be
drawn apart leaving glowing embers for cooking in the centre.

To resurrect the fire push them together and they soon
take flame again. This type of fire is used mainly to conserve fuel but also
saves chopping wood.

#### Other fuels

In areas where wood is scarce or unavailable other fuels must
be found.

**Animal droppings**: These
make excellent fuel – frontiersmen of the Wild West used ‘buffalo chips’ for
their fires. Dry the droppings thoroughly for a good smokeless fire. You can
mix them with grass, moss and leaves.

**Peat**: This is often
found on well-drained moors. It is soft and springy underfoot and may be
exposed on the edges of rocky outcrops – looking black and fibrous. It is
easily cut with a knife. Peat needs good ventilation when burning.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image109.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Stacked with plenty of air around it peat dries rapidly and is

</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip[Burning oil and water]

This mixture makes one of the hottest of all fires. Pierce a
small hole in the base of a tin can for each liquid and fit a tapered stick
into it to govern the flow (a). The oil and water run down a trough on to a
metal plate. Pulling the stick out increases the flow, pushing it in reduces
it. Try 2–3 drops water to 1 drop oil.

:::

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image110.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
First light a small fire under the plate to get it hot. The
mixture becomes highly volatile when heated. Light it above the plate. This
fire will burn almost anything.
</figcaption>
</figure>

**Coal**: This is sometimes
found on the surface – there are large deposits in the northern tundra.

**Shales**: These are often
rich in oil and burn readily. Some sands also contain oil – they burn with a
thick oily smoke which makes a good signal fire and also give off a good heat.

**Oils**: If you have had a
mechanical failure and have crashed or broken down with fuels intact you can
burn petroleum, anti-freeze, hydraulic fluid and other combustible liquids. Even insect repellent is
inflammable. Anti-freeze is an excellent primer for igniting heavier engine
oils. With a little potassium permanganate (from your survival kit) you can set
it alight in a few seconds.

In very cold areas drain oil from an engine sump
before it congeals. If you have no container drain it on to the ground to use
later in its solid state. Tyres, upholstery, rubber seals and much of any
wreckage can be burned. Soak less combustible materials in oil before trying to
make them burn.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image111.webp" />

Mix petrol with sand and burn it in a container as a stove, or
dig a hole and make a fire pit.

Burn oil by mixing in petrol or anti-freeze. Do not set
a light directly to liquid fuels but make a wick and let that provide the
flame. The same goes for insect repellent.

**Animal fats**: These
can also be used with a wick in a suitably ventilated tin to make a stove.
Bones can add bulk when fat is being burned as a fire (sometimes the only
available fuel in polar regions).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image112.webp" />

Start flame with tinder or a candle then place a network of
bones over it to support the fat or blubber. Use only a little fat at first.
Unless it is surplus, burning fat means sacrificing food value, but seal
blubber spoils rapidly and makes good fuel.

### Firelighting

Make a bed of tinder and form a wigwam of kindling around
it. In a strong wind lean the kindling against a log on the lee side. Ignite
the tinder. Once the kindling has caught add larger sticks. Or take a bundle of
dry twigs, no thicker than a match, light them first and place them in the
wigwam.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image113.webp" />

#### Damp matches

If your hair is dry and not too greasy roll the damp match
in it. Electricity should dry out the match.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image114.webp" />

Waterproof matches by dripping candle wax on to them. Rip it
off with a fingernail when about to strike one.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image115.webp" />

Strike a damp match by stabbing obliquely into the striker strip
instead of drawing the match along it.

**Remember**: Whenever you
strike a match light a candle. Many things in turn can then be lit from it –
saving matches. Place it in the wigwam of kindling to start a fire and remove
it as soon as the flame spreads. Only the smallest amount is burned and even a
small candle will last a long time.

However many lighters or fire-makers you carry,
still pack as many matches as you can – you can’t beat them. So-called
everlasting matches can be used over and over again but sooner or later even
they pack up. So carry ordinary matches as well. Work out which kind gives you
the most strikes for the weight and room they take up.

#### Using a lens

Strong direct sunlight, focussed through a lens, can
produce sufficient heat to ignite your tinder. Accidental fires are caused by
the sun shining through broken bottles on to dry leaves or pasture. Your
survival-kit magnifying glass or a telescope or camera lens will serve instead.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image116.webp" />

Shield tinder from wind. Focus sun’s rays to form the tiniest,
brightest spot of light. Keep it steady. Blow on it gently as it begins to
glow.

#### Powder from ammunition

If you are carrying arms you can use the gunpowder propellant
from a round to help ignite your tinder.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image117.webp" />

Break open the round and pour the gunpowder on to your tinder
before using your flint (a), or remove only half the powder and stuff a piece
of cloth into the cartridge case (b).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image118.webp" />

Chamber the round and fire as usual, into the ground. The
cloth will be ejected smouldering. Place it on tinder with the remaining
propellant and you will soon have a fire going.

:::tip[Matches]

Matches are the easiest way to start a fire. Carry the
non-safety ‘strike anywhere’ type and as many as possible. Pack them in
waterproof containers so that they cannot rub or rattle and accidentally
ignite. Waterproofing the matches themselves does both jobs.

Some people split all their matches in half and it has
been claimed that one can be successfully divided into six. But do NOT risk
wasting them – one that works is more use than six that don’t!

Strike split matches by pressing the business end
against the striking surface with a finger. If this burns the finger be ready
to cool it at once – in cold water, snow or even ‘spit on it and blow’.

:::

#### Flint and steel

Flint is a stone found in many parts of the world. If it
is struck vigorously with a piece of steel hot sparks fly off which will ignite
dry tinder. A saw-edged blade can produce more sparks than an ordinary knife
and should be in your kit. A block of magnesium with flint on its side is an
even more efficient device – magnesium burns very strongly.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image119.webp" />

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image120.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Strike the blade against the flint (a), or draw the saw across
the ridged surface of the flint supplied with it (b), close to tinder so that
sparks fall on it.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image121.webp" />

With a magnesium block, scrape slivers of magnesium on to
tinder first (c), then use the saw to produce the sparks.

#### Battery firelighting

A spark from a car battery can start your fire, and torch
and radio batteries should have sufficient power. You need two lengths of wire,
which you simply attach to the terminals. If you cannot find any wire you could
do it with a couple of spanners or other metal implements. Unless you have long
pieces of wire, take the battery out of the vehicle first.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image122.webp" />

Slowly bring the bare ends of the two pieces of wire together.
Just before they touch, a spark will jump across. You must catch it on your
tinder. A small piece of cloth with a little petrol on it makes the best
tinder, the petrol vapour igniting from the spark.

#### Fire bow

A simple fire-making technique, but one that needs lots of
practice. The friction of a hardwood spindle rotated on a softwood base
produces first fine wood-dust tinder, then heat. Balsa, pine and bamboo are
typically suitable softwoods; oak, ash and beech are hardwoods. Both must be
dry.

Gouge a small depression at the near end of the
baseboard and cut a cavity below it in which to place the tinder. Shape the
spindle evenly. Make the bow from a pliable shoot such as hazel or bamboo and
the string from hide, twine or a bootlace. You also need a hollowed piece of
stone or wood, or a small jar to steady the top of the spindle and exert
downward pressure.

Wind the bowstring once around the spindle. Place the spindle in the depression,
hold the steadying piece over its end and bear lightly down on it while the
other hand moves the bow backwards and forwards. This makes the spindle spin.
Increase the speed as the spindle starts drilling through the wood. When it
begins to enter the cavity apply more pressure and bow vigorously.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image123.webp" />

Keep on bowing until unable to continue. If successful the
tip, glowing like a cigarette, will drop on to your tinder, which, if you
gently blow on it, will burst into flame. You must keep the spindle upright and
steady.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image124.webp" />

It helps to kneel with one foot on the baseboard and to lock
the spindle arm on to this leg while bowing with the other hand. Keep the bow
strokes very even.

A V-shaped notch, as shown in the baseboard of the
hand-drill method, is also recommended.

#### Hand drill

This variation on the fire bow is useful in dry
territories with low humidity and little rainfall – making everything ‘tinder’
dry.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image125.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
1 In a baseboard
of hardwood cut a V-shaped collecting notch which will hold tinder, but still
allow air to reach it. Make a small depression near it. For a spindle use a
stem of hollow softer wood with a soft pith core.

</figure>

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image126.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
2 Roll the
spindle between the palms of the hands, running them down it with each burst of
spinning to press the spindle into the depression in the baseboard.
</figcaption>
</figure>

3 When the
friction makes the spindle tip glow red, blow gently to ignite the tinder
around it. Putting a pinch of sand in the spindle hole increases the friction
and speeds the heating of the tinder.

4 A cavity below
the spindle, as shown for the fire-bow method, is also recommended.

#### Fire plough

This method of ignition also works by friction. Cut a
straight groove in a soft wood baseboard and then ‘plough’ the tip of a
hardwood shaft up and down it. This first produces tinder and then eventually
ignites it.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image127.webp" />

#### Firelighting with chemicals

A survivor’s pack is not likely to include a complete
chemistry set but there are some very common chemicals that, if they are
available, can be used to produce combustion. The following mixtures can all be
ignited by grinding them between rocks or putting them under the friction point
in any of the types of fire drill already described. Mix them carefully,
avoiding contact with any metal objects. All are susceptible to dampness and
must be kept dry.

:::warning

Handle these chemicals carefully, sodium chlorate in particular
– it ignites from percussion, so avoid shaking it up or letting it spill.
Spilled weedkiller on a hard path has been known to ignite when stepped on or a
watering can was put down on it!

:::

**Potassium chlorate and sugar**
in a mixture of 3:1 by volume is a fierce-burning incendiary which can also be
ignited by dripping a few drops of sulphuric acid on to the mixture.

**Potassium permanganate and
sugar** mixed 9:1 is less sensitive and temperature is a critical factor
in how long it takes to ignite. The addition of glycerine will also produce
ignition.

**Sodium chlorate and sugar
mixed 3:1.**

- Sulphuric acid is found in car batteries.

- Potassium chlorate is found in some throat tablets –
their contents may be listed on the pack. Try crushing one and seeing if it
works.

- Potassium permanganate is included in your survival kit.

- Glycerine is a constituent of anti-freeze.

- Sodium chlorate is a weedkiller.

### Types of fire

However quickly you want to get a fire going, take time,
while you gather fuel and get the tinder ready, to choose the best location and
the best type of fire.

#### Fires for warmth

With a single fire outdoors only surfaces facing it are
warmed. With two fires you can sit between them – but that would use a lot of
fuel and, no matter which way the wind is blowing, you are bound to be covered
in smoke. Build one fire and use a reflector.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image128.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
A good reflector, close to the fire, not only reflects heat
back to you but also helps to make the smoke go upwards, drawn by hot currents
of air, instead of getting in your eyes. Use a reflector to direct heat into a
sleeping shelter.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
If there is no ready-made reflector, build one – and build
another reflector on the other side of the fire to reflect as much as possible
of its heat back to you.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Snake hole fire

This is a shielded fire that produces a good draught and
burns almost anything once lit. In the side of a firm earth bank excavate a
chamber about 45cm (18in) deep. From above drive a stick down into the chamber,
manoeuvre it about a little to make a chimney, removing the spoil that falls
below. Build the fire in the chamber.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image131.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
A snake hole fire is good for burning rubbish and the smoke
for preserving meat and fish. The snake hole fire entrance is best sited
downwind in windy conditions.
</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip[Spontaneous combustion]

Fire sometimes breaks out spontaneously in a compacted heap
of wet hay. It can be produced in cotton soaked in linseed oil provided the
atmosphere is warm and dry, but temperature can be critical. Either it will
burst into flames within a couple of hours or not at all. Not a reliable way of
firelighting – but a risk to be aware of.

:::

#### Cooking fires

These cooking fires are also good for heating.

#### Yukon stove

This fire, once lit, will burn almost anything. It takes a
lot of effort to build but is worth it for the whole structure gives off good
heat and the top can be used for cooking.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image132.webp" />

Dig a hole circular in shape and about 24cm (9in)
deep with a channel on one side leading down to it. Set rocks up all round the
outer edge of the main hole and build up a funnel, bridging over the channel
and gradually sloping inwards. Let the upper courses begin to open out again.
Seal all the spaces between the rocks with earth. The fire is shielded, the
chimney creating a good draught.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image133.webp" />

Light the fire first in the channel. When it gets going push
it beneath the chimney. Fuel is then fed in through the top of the chimney and
the rate of burning is controlled by opening or closing the top. This fire
leaves very little ash and will burn a very long time before it needs clearing
out.

#### Trench fire

This fire is sheltered from strong wind by being below
ground level. Dig a trench about 30 x 90cm (12 x 36in) and about 30cm (12in)
deep plus the depth of a layer of rocks with which you now line the bottom.
Build the fire on top of the rocks. Even when it has died down they will remain
hot and make an excellent grill.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image134.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
A spit placed across the embers is excellent for roasting.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Hobo stove

This stove provides a heat source several people can
huddle around and its top can be used for cooking. To make it you need
something like a 5-gallon oil drum.

<figure>
<div className="ratio ratio-16x9">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/915566411?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" loading="lazy" allow="fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">How to build a simple heat stove</figcaption>
</figure>

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image135.webp" />

Punch holes in the bottom and around the bottom of the sides
of the drum for draught to enter. Cut out a panel on one side, about 5cm (2in)
from the bottom through which to stoke the fire.

Punch holes in the top if to be used only for heating,
but make them on the upper part of one side if you don’t want smoke coming
through the top.

Set the whole drum on a ring of stones so that there is
plenty of draught beneath.

## **Signalling**

> **The first requirement for rescue is to let others know
of your situation and, if possible, your location. Once you are in contact you
can pass on other information.**
>
> **The obvious technique is to use a mobile or satellite
phone, which should be used sparingly, but if you don’t have the luxury of such
systems then there are a number of internationally recognized distress signals.
The letters SOS (for Save Our Souls) is probably the best known. It can be
written, transmitted by radio, spelt out by semaphore or sent in Morse code by
any method.**
>
> **The signal ‘Mayday’ (a phonetic rendering of the French
m’aidez – help me) is the one used in most radiotelecommunications by ships and
planes.**

#### Vehicle or aircraft wreckage

If you are with a stranded vehicle or downed aircraft it may
provide many useful signalling aids. If there has been no fire there will be
supplies of fuel, oil and hydraulic fluid which can be burned. Tyres and
electrical insulation on a fire will generate black smoke.

Glass and chrome make great reflectors, especially
engine cowlings and hubcaps. Lifejackets, dinghies, and parachutes are all
brightly coloured and eye-catching. Arrange these colourful and shiny objects
around your location where they will be most visible and attract attention.

Switch lights on at night – or if batteries are
running low keep them in reserve to flash headlamps, sound the horn and
otherwise attract attention, when passing aircraft or signs of possible
searchers are observed.

#### Fire and smoke

Fire – both flames and smoke – is an excellent way of
attracting attention. Establishing signal fires is one of the primary tasks
once the immediate needs for treatment of injury and provision of shelter from
harsh elements have been met. In a large group some people should set about
gathering fuel for a campfire and for signal fires as soon as possible.

#### Where to site signals

When siting signals take full account of the terrain.
Choose high points for light signals. If you are on a ridge, erecting an
unusual silhouette may attract attention. If you are laying out marks on the
ground, use level ground or ensure that they are on slopes that are not likely
to be overlooked in the usual pattern of aerial search.

:::tip[Survival tip]

It is usual for planes to fly over hilly territory from the
lower to the higher ridges. This creates the problem that the slopes behind the
ridges may be hidden as the plane approaches. If in doubt, signals nearer the
tops of ridges should be seen from whichever direction the rescue aircraft is
travelling.

:::

#### International codes

When contact has been established more complex international
codes (shown later) will enable you to signal your basic needs, if verbal
communication is not possible.

With air or sea rescue it may then be necessary to
prepare a landing strip or to help rig lines or apparatus, and some knowledge
of basic procedures will greatly facilitate the operation. (See [Helicopter
Rescue](#helicopter-rescue).)

#### Transmitters

Dinghies, liferafts and even personal lifejackets are sometimes
equipped with transmitters which send out bleeps indicating position, though
these are not usually effective over a very long range. Many emergency radio
transmitters are also very limited in range and to avoid wasting precious
batteries should be held in reserve until there is some chance of their signals
being picked up. With effective radio apparatus, however, distress signals
should be sent out immediately and transmitted at regular intervals.

Check instructions on all transmitting apparatus. Ship
and plane transmitters can operate on many wavelengths, but some emergency
equipment is set to fixed distress channels.

Generally speaking, the portable VHF transceivers used
by mountaineering teams can communicate only with stations in a direct line of
sight and without any intervening obstruction (though sometimes a permanent
relay station may be established on a strategic high point). Such sets are
usually tuned to a mountain rescue frequency but procedures should be
established before departure.

If you have a working transmitter, check the battery
situation. Can the vehicle engine still be used to generate electricity or
recharge the batteries? Conserve fuel for this purpose and plan your
transmissions to a pattern rather than attempting long continuous periods on
the air. If anyone picks up your signal they can then work out that they can
expect it again.

#### Noise

Noise is also an excellent way of attracting attention if
you know that people are within earshot. The International Mountain Distress
Signal, apart from signalling SOS, is six whistles a minute (or six waves,
light flashes, etc.) followed by a minute’s silence, then repeated. A shout may
be enough if you are trapped, or near help but too injured to reach it.

#### Be imaginative

Do not reject even such ideas as the message in a bottle.
This particular method has a low chance of success if you are shipwrecked in
the middle of the Pacific but on a river a more noticeable floating object
which carries a clear message might well attract attention – a small raft with
a bright sail labelled SOS, for instance. Use your imagination to think of ways
that will attract attention to you and your plight, without using up valuable
energy and resources.

#### Moving on

If you decide that rescue is unlikely, and that your best
plan is to make your own way back, you should leave clear signs behind so that
if searchers do track down the disaster spot they have an indication of the
route that you have taken. On your way you may have more success in attracting
attention if closer to regular flight routes or in more open territory.

## **Signals and codes**

#### Fire signals

Three fires is an internationally recognized distress signal.
Ideally they should be placed in a triangle at equal distances apart, an
arrangement which also makes them easier to feed with fuel, but if that is not
possible any grouping serves, provided that the fires are clearly separated.
However, if fuel is scarce, or if you are too badly injured or too weak from
hunger to maintain several fires, use only your campfire.

You can’t keep signal fires going all the time but
they should be prepared, covered to keep them dry, and maintained, ready to be
lit to attract the attention of any passing aircraft. Build them with plenty of
easily ignited tinder so that they will get going rapidly when lit. Birch bark
makes an ideal tinder. Other tinder materials are described under _Fire_ in _Make Camp_.

:::tip[Be aware]

- Keep a stock of green boughs or supplies of oil or rubber
close by to create smoke if needed.
- Among vegetation or close to trees, build an earth wall
around each fire to contain it.
- There is no point building fires among trees where they
cannot be seen, the canopy will block out the signal. Place them in a clearing.

:::

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image136.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
If by a lake or river, build rafts to place your fires on and
anchor or tether them securely in position. Arrow indicates direction of
current.
</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip[Be aware]

Almost any signal repeated six times will serve as a distress
signal. Depending on your location, this could be six fires, six columns of
smoke, six loud whistles, six gunshots – even six flashes of light. If using
noises or lights, wait one minute between each group of six signals.

:::

Petrol can be used as a firelighter but DON’T just
pour it on the fire. Use a piece of rag as a wick, soak it in petrol and lay it
to the tinder. Don’t light it straight away. Carry the fuel can off to a safe
distance and wait a few seconds before lighting the wick. If a fire does not
light first time pull the tinder apart, checking that there are no sparks or
embers still burning, before adding extra petrol.

#### Torch trees

Small isolated trees make excellent fire signals. Build a
fire between the boughs. Use plenty of dry twigs – old birds’ nests make good
fire starters. This fire will ignite the foliage and produce plenty of smoke. If
a tree is dead start a fire at its base. It will burn for a long time leaving
you free to attend to other signals.

**Note**: Do not risk
starting a forest fire. Apart from the damage this will cause, your life will
be in greater jeopardy.

#### Luminous cone fires

On a clear and open site make a tripod with a platform to
support a fire. The platform keeps the tinder off damp ground, or you can store
more firewood beneath it. Use a covering of evergreen boughs to keep the cone
dry; they will burn brightly and give off a good smoke.

Cover the complete cone fire with bright coloured
material, if available – a parachute would be ideal. This will not only keep
the fire dry and ready to burn, but will itself be noticeable during the day.
Whip it off when you ignite the fire – you may not attract attention the first
time.

When alight the glow of this cone can be seen for
miles. In an exposed location a smaller fire inside a conical tent or tepee of
parachute fabric will also make a noticeable beacon. Ensure there is a smoke
and heat outlet at the top of the tepee and keep the fire under control. If it
is on a slope add fuel from the side or above the fire so that you do not
excessively mask the firelight – though some flickering of movement before it
may help to attract attention.

Keep these tripods well maintained, ensuring that wood is dry
enough to light at a moment’s notice and that the supply is not poached for
other uses. Drive the pole ends into the ground to prevent tipping over in
strong winds.

</figure>

#### Use wreckage to help fire-signalling

Stand a fire on a piece of metal from an aircraft or
vehicle. It will keep kindling from damp ground, when hot will increase
convection and make the fire burn brightly and, if polished, will act as a
reflector intensifying the brightness. Three such fires become an immediately
recognizable distress signal.

:::tip[Be aware]

Smoke not only helps the pilot of a rescue aircraft find you,
it also shows the surface wind direction. Make sure that smoke is downwind of
the landing site and of any panel codes that you have laid so that it does not
obscure them from above.

#### Smoke indicators

During daylight smoke is a good locator, so have plenty of
smoke-producing material ready to put on your fires. Choose this material to
give off a smoke that shows up well against the surroundings.

Light smoke will stand out against dark earth or dark
green forest. Produce it with green grass, leaves, moss and ferns. Any wet
material will produce a good smudge fire and damp mats and seat covers will
smoulder for a long time. This will also keep flying insects at bay.

Dark smoke will show best against snow or desert
sand. Use rubber or oil to produce it. If atmospheric conditions make the smoke
hang in layers along the ground then build up the fire to increase its heat.
Thermal currents will then take the smoke to a good height.

### Ground-to-air signals

These letters are internationally recognized emergency
signals. FILL is a useful mnemonic for remembering the main ones. The single
bar: I is the most important and the easiest to make. A pilot will risk a great
deal to answer such an emergency. Make them as large and as noticeable as
possible using colour contrast or shadow. A recommended size is 10m long and 3m
wide (34ft and 10ft) for each symbol, with 3m (10ft) between symbols.

Lay or make these panel codes out in the open, avoid
steep gullies or ravines and do not make them on reverse slopes. Use the marker
panels from your [survival pouch](#survival-pouch), or if you do not
have these – improvise. Lay out pieces of wreckage or dig out the signs as a
shallow trench, banking up the earth so that it increases the depth of the
shadow. Use rocks or boughs to accentuate it.

On snow, even tramping out the symbols will show
clearly until the next snowfall.

Once contact has been made, a message dropped or
signalled by the aircraft can be answered with A or Y (affirmative) and N
(negative) signals, or Morse code or body signals.

#### Night signals

These signals will attract attention during daylight, even if
you are asleep or injured. If you have a supply of petrol or other inflammable
substances, you can make signals which will work at night. Dig or scrape an SOS
(or any symbol) in the earth, sand or snow and, when the signal is needed, pour
petrol into it and ignite it.

**Note**: You MUST
destroy these signals if rescued. They will go on working long after you have
gone.

### Message signalling

You do not need to learn a complicated system of semaphore.
The international Morse code can be transmitted by flashing lights on and off,
by a simple heliograph, by waving a flag or a shirt tied to a stick or using
sound.

**Note**: Don’t rely upon
your memory – carry a copy of the code on your person. Even if you are a
regular user and know it backwards others may need it who do not.

There is a procedure to follow when sending and
receiving messages. Learn the special codes to make the operation easier.

#### Heliograph

Use the sun and a reflector to flash light signals. Any shiny
object will serve – polish a tin lid, glasses, a piece of foil – though a
hand-mirror is best. Sustained flashes are dashes and quick ones dots. If you
do not know Morse code, even random flashes should attract attention. At least
learn the code for SOS.

A flash can be seen at a great distance and even when
you do not have a specific contact to aim for may attract someone’s attention.
It’s worth trying, since it requires little energy. Sweep the horizon during
the day. If a plane approaches closely make intermittent flashes or you may
dazzle the pilot. Once you are certain you have been seen, STOP signalling.

**Note**: Practise this
form of signalling, but unless you are in a survival situation, do NOT signal
to aircraft or ‘transmit’ messages which could cause alarm or danger to others.

#### Using a heliograph

If you have a double-sided reflector and can punch a hole in
it you will have something close to a standard issue heliograph.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image154.webp" />

Sight the person, plane, ship, etc, that you wish to
contact through the hole in the heliograph (a) in the general direction of the
sun, so that the sun will shine through the hole (b). You will see a spot of
light on your face (c).

Angle the mirror so that the dot of light on your face
‘disappears’ back through the hole in the mirror – still sighting your contact.

If the sun is at such an angle that this manoeuvre does
not work bring the mirror close to your eyes and a hand lined up between you
and the contact. Angle the mirror to flash on to your hand, then move the hand
away.

#### Single-sided reflector

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image155.webp" />

With an improvised reflector pick up the sunlight to get an
image on the ground or some other surface and lead it in the direction of the
aircraft or other potential contact.

#### Rag signals

Tie a flag or a piece of brightly coloured clothing to a pole
and move it left for dashes and right for dots. Exaggerate each movement with a
figure-of-eight movement.

This simple signing may work without figure-
of-eight movements at closer range. Keep ‘dash’ pauses on the left, slightly
longer than ‘dot’ movements to the right.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image156.webp" />

#### Body signals

This series of signals will be understood by airmen and can
be used to signal to them. Note the changes from frontal to sideways positions
and the use of leg and body posture as well as hand movements. Use a cloth in
the hand to emphasize the YES and NO signals. Make all signals in a clear and
exaggerated manner.

#### Response to body signals

To acknowledge messages received from the ground, the
pilot of an aircraft will perform one of these manoeuvres:

**Message received and understood**:  
_In daylight_ – flying the plane and tipping the wings in a rocking movement side to side  
_At night_ – flashing green lights

**Message received but NOT understood**:  
_In daylight_ – flying the plane in a right-handed circle  
_At night_ – flashing red lights

### Mountain rescue code

These sound, light and pyrotechnic codes are recognized
internationally by mountain rescue services:

**Message: SOS**  
Flare signal – Red  
Sound signal – 3 short blasts, 3 long, 3 short  
_Repeat after 1 minute interval_  
Light signal – 3 short flashes, 3 long, 3 short  
_Repeat after 1 minute interval_

**Message: HELP NEEDED**  
Flare signal – Red  
Sound signal – 6 blasts in quick succession  
_Repeat after 1 minute interval_  
Light signal – 6 flashes in quick succession  
_Repeat after 1 minute interval_

**Message: MESSAGE UNDERSTOOD**  
Flare signal – White  
Sound signal – 3 blasts in quick succession  
_Repeat after 1 minute interval_  
Light signal – 3 flashes in quick succession  
_Repeat after 1 minute interval_

**Message: RETURN TO BASE**  
Flare signal – Green  
Sound signal – Prolonged succession of blasts  
Light signal – Prolonged succession of flashes

#### Flares

Any flare will be investigated during a search, regardless of
colour, but choose one best fitted to the location.

- In closely wooded country green does not stand out but
red does.
- Over snow white merges – green and red are best.

Familiarize yourself with the types of flare. Make
sure you understand the instructions, for some flares eject a white-hot ball of
magnesium that will burn a hole in anything it hits – your chest or dinghy – if
they are misdirected.

#### Types of flare

Some flares are hand-held and reversible. One end produces
smoke for daytime use, the other a flare for use at night. The higher these are
held the easier they are to see. Flares and rockets which are fired into the
air will be visible for a greater distance. One type reaches a height of 90m
(300ft) where a parachute opens holding the flare suspended for several
minutes. Other rockets produce a loud bang and colour balls.

Keep flares dry and away from naked flames and heat
sources. Ensure that safety pins are in position and will not accidentally drop
out, but also check that they are not bent over in such a way that they could
not be quickly removed when necessary.

#### Handling flares

Hand-held flares are cylindrical tubes with a cap at each
end. The top cap is often embossed with a letter or pattern so that it can be
identified by touch in the dark. Remove it first. Then remove the base cap to
expose a short string and a safety pin, or other safety device. Point the flare
upwards and away from you and anyone else in case you accidentally fire it.
Remove the pin, or turn to the fire position. Hold the flare at arm’s length,
at shoulder height, pointing directly upwards. Sharply pull the firing string
vertically downwards. Brace yourself as you do so for there will be a kickback.
Some flares and maroons have a spring mechanism trigger like that of a mousetrap.

Very pistols fire various cartridges. To fire them load
the pistol, point it skywards, cock the hammer and then squeeze the trigger.

Mini-flares are more usual equipment today, lighter
than Very pistols but as effective. They require handling with the same care.
To use, screw a flare of the selected colour into the end of the discharger,
aim skyward, pull back striker – FIRE!

:::danger

Hand-held flares get hot. When they burn down do not drop them
into the bottom of a boat, where they could start a fire, or burn straight
through an inflatable.

:::

### Information signals

These are signals to leave behind if you leave the scene of
the crash or abandon camp.

Make a large arrow shape to indicate the direction in
which you have set off that will be visible from the air, and other direction
markers which can be interpreted at ground level.

Signs on the ground will draw attention to your
presence or past presence and the direction markers will help rescuers to
follow your trail. Continue to make them, not only for people to follow but to
establish your own route if you wish to retrace it and as a guide if you lose
your sense of direction and start going back on your trail.

At camp leave written messages in containers to
detail your plans. Hang them from tripods or trees and draw attention to them
with markers.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image168.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Direction markers could include rocks or debris placed in
arrow shape (a), stick left in crooked support, top in direction followed (b),
grasses tied in an overhand knot with end hanging in direction followed (c),
forked branches laid with fork pointing in direction followed (d), small rocks
set upon larger rocks, with small rock beside (e), indicating a turn or arrow-
or arrowhead-shape notches cut in tree trunks (f). A cross of sticks or stones
(g), means ‘Not this way’.

## **Search**

> **Awareness of search procedures will show how important
it is for any expedition or trip to register its route plans and for survivors
to stay as close as possible to that course, to set clear signals to draw
attention to their location and to mark any camp they have abandoned (leaving
information about their subsequent plans).**

A search will start from the last known location and sweep on
the proposed route. An assessment will be made of probable strategy adopted,
given the terrain and the weather conditions. In mountain areas, for instance,
it is likely that strong winds would make the survival party use the lee sides
of ridges and descend from high ground. If no trace is found of them on the
expected route these are the areas in which the search will be concentrated.

The effect of contour will be considered: by studying
the ground the search party may assume that survivors were forced off route by
the lie of the land. To make the searchers’ job easier, make a cairn of rocks
or other noticeable construction on prominent ground where it cannot fail to be
noticed and leave a message there in a waterproof bag or in the pocket of a colourful
piece of clothing. Give information on your intentions and on the state of your
party.

If your route has been checked and the obvious refuge
places in the locality searched, the rescuers will extend the search to cover
the whole area of your disappearance. Ideally this will be done from the air
but severe weather which creates bad flying conditions and poor visibility may
mean it has to be done on foot, even if planes are available.

The number of searchers and the type of terrain will
dictate the search pattern best suited to the situation.

### Search patterns

The first search will be made along the route you were
supposed to have taken.

#### Aerial search

Search patterns from the air cover both sides of the intended
flight path of missing aircraft or your known route.

If weather conditions are favourable a night search can
be made, for lights will be clearly visible and the search can be made from a
greater height so that a wider area can be covered in each sweep. If this does
not produce results the area will still be rechecked by daylight.

If you are signalling to an aircraft and it turns
away – keep watching. It may be following one of those recognized search
patterns and you will be able to anticipate critical moments for signalling.

#### Base line

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image169.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Base line, or box search, is carried out when there has been a
high wind or bad weather conditions on your known route (a). Searchers should
deduce that you may have veered from the route to the lee side of a slope for
shelter.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Watercourse

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image170.webp" />

Watercourse search takes in all the tributaries, using the
main stream as base line. This is undertaken when your last known position was
on or near a river.

#### Fan

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image171.webp" />

Fan search is used when your last known position (x) is fairly
certain but it is impossible to deduce the direction you may have taken.

#### Contour search

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image172.webp" />

Contour search allows mountains and valleys to be searched
with maximum thoroughness. Steep valleys should be searched several times by
flying along them.

#### Creeping line

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image173.webp" />

Creeping line search, beginning in a corner of the search
area, is particularly useful when only a single aircraft is available. It
follows parallels which should be towards and away from the sun for a land
search so that any reflection from a missing aircraft or other wreckage and
signals will be more easily seen.

#### Track crawl

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image174.webp" />

The primary search pattern, or track crawl search, parallels
both sides of a missing aircraft’s expected flight path (a), or travelling
known land route. After flying for one hour, turn around and fly the reverse
pattern.

#### Square search

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image175.webp" />

Square search is useful when a comparatively small area is to
be covered. Search starts in the last known location (x) and works outwards. If
unsuccessful fly over last known location and start search in other direction.
This ensures both sides are covered.

#### Combined searches

At sea a combined sea-and-air search is desirable. If the
aircraft locates survivors the ships can pick them up. The ship can also act as
a datum point for all aircraft. Rescue aircraft are equipped with supplies to drop
to survivors to help them as they await pick-up by a surface vessel.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/01_essentials/image176.webp" />

### Helicopter rescue

While aeroplanes are used for the search, helicopters are
used in most countries to carry out the actual rescue, especially on land.
Where possible the ‘copter will make a landing to take on survivors and fly
them out. It may be possible for the pilot to find a convenient landing site
nearby to which survivors can make their way, but it will be easier for the
survivors to check out suitability at ground level and to create a site if
necessary.

The helicopter will require an obstruction-free
approach and exit path, both INTO the prevailing winds. The ground should be
level (the slope should not exceed seven degrees – a gradient of 1 in 10). The
touchdown surface should be firm and free of loose materials – remove leaves,
twigs, everything. There must be no holes, tree stumps or rocks which could
cause damage to the aircraft.

#### Selecting a landing site

Look for a natural clearing. In close country a river bank on
a large bend is often the best natural landing place (LP).

Alternatively climb a spur and select a level piece
of ground free of large trees. If you need to, cut down trees to clear more
space. The trees will fall down the spur without blocking the area and a clear
approach and exit path can be obtained across the spur. Do not attempt cutting
a landing place on flat ground; it will take forever to create a clear approach
and exit.

#### Non-landing rescue

In an emergency, helicopters will take considerable risks to
rescue survivors. They may hover with one skid on a rock to make embarkation
possible – but whenever it can be done create a proper landing place and
minimize risks.

Most helicopters are equipped with a winch. If a
landing place is out of the question you can be lifted from the ground while
the helicopter hovers. All that is needed is an opening or clearing through
which to extricate you.

#### Wind indication

It is important to indicate the direction and strength of the
wind at the landing place so that the pilot can select the best approach, and
keep the aircraft stable while carrying out the rescue. Smoke is an ideal
indicator, but do not place it so that it obscures the touchdown area.

If a fire is not practical make a T sign from
contrasting material and place it at the downwind edge of the landing place
with the horizontal bar of the T placed upwind.

If there is nothing to make a T shape from, a person
standing on the far downwind side of the landing place with their arms
outstretched and with their back to the wind can form a living symbol for the
pilot. Don’t make this signal until you have to – and then only in the correct
position. It is very similar to another body signal, which means ‘need help’.

:::tip[Landing place]

PREPARING SITE  
A level cleared area is needed at least 26m (85ft) in diameter. A further 5m
(17ft) is needed all around, cleared to a height of 60cm (2ft). There should be
a clear approach path into the prevailing wind with no obstructions within an
angle of 15 degrees of the central landing pad.

Mark the touchdown point with an H. You can make it
from inlaid rocks (keeping the surface smooth), clothing securely anchored, or
panel markers. On snow, trample it down firmly to prevent it swirling and, in
dry areas, water the surface to keep the dust down.

READY-MADE PAD  
If a spur, mound or area of raised ground is nearby, this will be easier to
clear and will provide an easy approach and exit across the spur if the wind
direction is satisfactory.

MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN  
The payload of the helicopter is cut drastically with increased altitude so, if
possible, make the landing site below 1830m (6000ft).

In mountains updraughts and downdraughts of air can be
considerable according to the pattern of the land and its relationship to
prevailing winds. Select a site that gives maximum lift in the direction in
which the helicopter will take off. Soft wet snow will cling to the helicopter
and hamper its take-off. Try to compact the landing surface as much as
possible. Powdery snow will swirl under the rotors’ downwash and restrict the
pilot’s vision. Stamp this down, too.

:::

#### Night rescue

The helicopter will itself have powerful lights by which the
landing or lift-off of survivors can take place but you will need lights to
bring the pilot in to the landing place. Flares and fires will give an
indication of your position once the helicopter is within range.

If you are illuminating from the ground with
torches, vehicle headlights or other beams shine them skyward at first to
attract attention but, once the pilot has seen you, keep the beams low so that
they do NOT dazzle the pilot, and shine them on to the touchdown or winching
area.

#### Sea rescue

If survivors are being winched up from a ship it will help
the pilot to place the deck at an angle of approximately 40 degrees to the
right of the eye of the wind. If you can control the vessel give a wind speed
over the deck of about 29kph (18mph).

#### Winching techniques

A double lift is the usual method but a single lift is
sometimes used.

**Double lift**: With a
double lift a crewman is lowered on the winch with another strop for the
survivor. During the lift the crewman supports the survivor with his legs,
gripping with them around the midsection, and supports the head with his hands.
After the strop has been put in place and tightened keep arms down by the sides
and do not lift them – just lie back and enjoy it!

**Single lift**: With a
single lift you fit yourself into the strop. When you have placed it under your
armpits and securely tightened the grommet give the ‘thumbs up’ sign. Once acknowledged
make no further signals until aboard the chopper – if you raise your arms you
risk slipping out of the strop!

:::tip[Helicopter precautions on landing]

When a helicopter touches down at the LP the rotors will be
turning. The approach to the aircraft is therefore particularly important both
for your own safety and that of the helicopter.

- NEVER approach from the rear. This is a blind spot for the
crew and the tail rotor is unprotected. On sloping ground always approach up
the slope – bringing you up below the blades.
- NEVER approach down a slope close to the helicopter. You
could be at risk from the blades.
- Make sure that you are not carrying anything which could
foul the main rotor. If carrying a radio, stow the aerial.
- Keep all sharp objects away from the body panels of the
helicopter. They are of light gauge alloy and easily damaged.
- Sit in the seat allocated to you by the crewman, fasten the
seat belt and keep fastened until told otherwise.
- Do not attempt to alight until the engine has been shut
down after you have landed – even then, wait for directions.

:::note[Case study: Emergency on Everest]

This is a tale I use to illustrate that it’s not a
weakness to give up on an adventure if the weather or circumstances prevent you
from reaching your goal safely. There’s always another day; but if you come
unstuck there’s no tomorrow.

Two British Army soldiers lost 19 toes between them
and almost perished on the treacherous slopes of Everest’s South Summit on May
16, 1976.

After reaching the high altitude camp they set out to
make their final assault on the world’s most unforgiving mountain. Leaving
sleeping bags, provisions, and radios behind, they took only oxygen with them
in their rucksacks.

The weather was fine as they set off at 6.30am, but
the loose, powdery snow severely restricted their progress and a 90-minute
climb stretched to six hours. Their cut-off point to reach the South Summit
before making their way to the peak was 2.30pm. As it gets colder and darker,
the air thins, making it difficult to breathe, and by 2pm, they were still one
hour away from the peak. They already feared it would be almost impossible to
get back to camp safely and stored bottles of oxygen for use on the descent.
Despite knowing the risks, they decided to continue and hit the summit at
3.30pm. After taking photographs and celebrating the immense achievement of
making it to the top of Everest, they began their descent. By this time, a
blizzard had set in and the snow had covered their footprints.

Conditions gradually worsened until it felt like hell
on earth. They found the oxygen they had stored earlier, dug a hole in the snow
and snuggled down together, their feet in their rucksacks. The winds were
horrendous and the altitude meant they were running out of oxygen fast. One of
the soldiers had removed his goggles during the descent in order to be able to
see more clearly, but this had resulted in snow blindness. With his fellow
climber suffering from breathing difficulties, the other
removed his glove to open the oxygen
bottle they had stored, exposing him to frostbite. He was to lose the fingers
of his right hand. They huddled together in their snow hole, desperately
fighting for survival in the winds of up to 170 mph and temperatures of 40
below zero. With no radio or provisions, they were at the mercy of the
elements, the high altitude making them so drowsy they had to punch and smack
each other to stay awake. As the night wore on they drifted in and out of
consciousness.

At 9am next morning, a team from Camp Five, making their
own assault on the summit, found the two soldiers and began the painful and
difficult task of getting them down to safety. Both men’s feet were frozen and
the first climber’s snow blindness made it impossible for him to walk unaided.
He had to be helped with every footstep.

Back home doctors attempted to save the men’s toes but
the condition of their feet deteriorated and the toes had to be amputated. The
second climber also lost the thumb and top halves of his fingers on his right
hand. Both men went on to further adventures, unimpeded by their injuries or
experiences.

Although they were extremely well trained soldiers,
they had carried on, knowing the weather was worsening. Perhaps the wise choice
would have been to turn back, but they would have had to start again the next
day, the next week or the next year. Weather conditions on the mountain are
never predictable and death is an ever-present risk for those who want to reach
the top.

**LESSONS LEARNT**

- If there’s a problem, always go back. Losing face and
giving up is better than losing your life or risking injury. Give yourself a
cut-off point and stick to it.
- Always have safety equipment. Carrying provisions and
equipment may hinder progress but they are lifesavers.
- Help each other. These soldiers stayed alive because they
acted as a team.
- Never panic and always remember that the will to live
will conquer the worst elements.

:::note[Case study: judgement call]

Should you ever take risks with drinking water?

This very much depends on the situation you are in. I
drank water infested with mosquito larvae when I was in the Yemen. I was
severely dehydrated and knew the water would make me ill, but it kept me alive
until I got to camp next day. The longer-term effects were stomach upsets and
sickness but the consequences outweighed the risks. It’s a decision you have to
make based on the circumstances.

:::note[Case study: mental stamina]

This is one of my favourite stories of someone with
incredible tenacity and resourcefulness.

Hiroo Onoda was 23 years old when he was sent to
Lubang, an island covered with rainforest 120km (74 miles) south of Manila in
the Philippines. As a soldier, his commander told him to carry on fighting for
Japan even if the rest of his comrades were wiped out. And this is what he
did... for 30 years! In the first few years on Lubang, Hiroo kept in touch with
other Japanese soldiers. But one by one, his comrades surrendered or died.
Eventually, Hiroo was on his own. He lived on bananas and coconuts, and
sometimes managed to catch a bird or steal a cow to eat. He made shoes out of
old tyres stitched together with pieces of straw, and he built shelters out of
bamboo, vines and branches in the forest. Always fearful of an enemy attack,
Hiroo kept switching hide-outs and he shot at anyone who came close to him.
When Japan surrendered in 1945, planes dropped leaflets over the island to
announce the end of the war. Hiroo picked up these leaflets, but he was sure
that they were lies written by the American enemy. Friends and relatives
visited Lubang to tell him that the war was over, but he remained suspicious
and continued to hide.

After thirty years on the island, Hiroo came across a
Japanese student called Norio on a camping holiday. Hiroo nearly shot Norio,
but Norio managed to persuade him that people back in Japan were worried about
him. Hiroo told Norio that he would only give up if his commander told him to.

Luckily, his commander was still alive – he had become
a bookseller in Japan. The commander flew to Lubang, and at last, on 10th March
1974, Hiroo Onoda gave up his lonely life. By this time, he was 52 years old.

**LESSONS LEARNT**

- I always tell people that survival is 85 per cent mental,
15 per cent physical. You can have all the survival skills in the world, but if
you don’t have the will to live, no amount of training will keep you alive.

:::note[Case study: drifting into danger]

The most dangerous thing in a soldier’s life can be
R&amp;R when you’ve too much money in your pocket and you want to spend it!

I was drinking in a bar in Kenya when two Aussies came
in and said they wanted to take a boat out and could I run through the
controls. I told them to come back next morning. By that time I’d been drinking
all night, but boarded the boat with them, explained the mechanics, then
dropped out into the sea. I ended up floating in the water for 12 hours,
totally disorientated before I managed to drift back to land. I’d taken my
shirt off to protect my head, but my body was badly burned.

No one in camp had missed me because they thought I
was in my bunk sleeping off the night’s alcohol. An experience never to be
repeated!

**LESSONS LEARNT**

- Only ever carry alcohol for surgical uses; it impairs your
judgement and causes fluid loss leading to dehydration, which can be fatal.

:::note[Case study: stick together]

I often use this case study because it highlights exactly how not to plan and execute an expedition.

While exploring Lows Gully, on Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia, in 1994, two British officers and three Hong Kong Chinese soldiers were trapped for 16 days with only enough rations for three days. At the time they were found, following a huge rescue operation by the British and Malaysian military, medics said that they were on the point of starvation. Mount Kinabalu is not considered a tough climb. The plan was to travel light, so armed with ten days’ rations and a video camera, but without radio and flares, they descended into the abyss of Lows Gully.

On the morning of the third day, the expedition reached the edge  of the abyss and the men saw for the first time the task ahead of them. The team was split into two groups as not all of the men were in good enough shape to continue with the descent immediately. The fittest men forged ahead while a second group rested with the intention of following when they were ready.

When the second team finally began their descent they had only three days’ rations left and, with novice climbers, they made slow progress. Meanwhile, at the bottom of the gully, and with only four days’ rations left, the advance team began to negotiate their way out of danger, but they met with the gully’s unique and unpredictable weather system: mists over the mountain gave way to torrential rains and with nowhere else to go, the water poured down into the gully. In the days that followed, as they slowly struggled through the undergrowth, the team leader and one other team member became separated from the other three in their group. Unable to find them, the two men were forced to continue. With no rations, they attempted to live off the forest, but with dire consequences as one of them became violently ill.

On their return, after 17 days, they learned that the other three in their party had already made it back safely. But the second team were still stranded. The Malaysian Army and a Royal Air Force rescue team were dispatched to search for the team and, after ten days, a Malaysian helicopter finally spotted them and rescued the group. It was 31 days since they had set out.

**LESSONS LEARNT**

- Plan adequately
- Keep the group together
- Don’t underestimate the environment you are going to
- Ensure that you start with enough supplies for survival
and for rescue
