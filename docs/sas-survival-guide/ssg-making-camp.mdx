Selecting where to camp and knowing how to make a good shelter are essential skills. A wide range of shelter construction methods, using available materials, are described, from the simplest windbreak to dwellings suitable for long-term occupation.

You will need to make fire and to choose the right type of fire construction. Fires for both general warmth and for cooking purposes are detailed. Guidance on food preparation, cooking and preservation will ensure that food is safe and not wasted. Camp organization and hygiene are as important for health and morale for the single survivor as for a large group.

Methods of making tools, camp equipment, clothes, ropes and nets will all improve survival conditions, and skills in knot-making will have many uses.

## **Shelter and making camp**

> **Shelter is necessary to give shade, to repel wind and rain and to keep in warmth. Sleep and adequate rest are essential and the time and effort you put into making your shelter comfortable will make them easier to get. If you are the victim of a plane crash or a vehicle that has let you down, it may provide a shelter or materials from which one can be built – but if there is fire or the threat of fuel tanks exploding, wait until it has burned out before attempting salvage.**

If you are the unequipped victim of an accident, are trapped by unexpected mist or caught by nightfall in terrain where it is not safe to proceed, or if exhaustion or injury prevents you going further, you may have to make do with any natural shelter that you can find for the night, or until you can more fully assess the situation. In this case, virtually any protection from wind, rain and cold will be welcome. If movement down a slope seems risky, traversing even a short way along the contour may bring you out of the wind. If no cave or crevice is available to give shelter, make use of any hollow in the ground. Add to its height, if you can, by piling up rocks – but make sure that any structure is stable and use a backpack, if you have one, to increase the windshield before settling down on the leeward side.

If there is still daylight to see by, and you have no injuries to handicap you and are not isolated by unnegotiable cliffs or other barriers, it will be worth seeking possible better places in the vicinity. For a long-term camp you should find a secure site with convenient access to your major needs.

:::info[bad places to camp]

1. Hilltops exposed to wind (move down and look for shelter on the lee side).
2. Valley bottoms and deep hollows – could be damp and, especially when the sky is clear, more liable to frost at night.
3. Hillside terraces where the ground holds moisture.
4. Spurs which are on a game trail.

:::

#### Where to camp

If you are on high exposed ground go lower down to find a sheltered spot, but on low, wet ground you will need to climb higher to find somewhere securely dry. Look for somewhere sheltered from the wind, on rising ground that has no risk of flooding and is safe from rock falls or avalanches.

Hot air rises, cold air sinks, so valley bottoms will often contain pockets of colder air and, in cold weather, be susceptible to frost and damp mist. In areas that get plenty of rainfall, terraces across a slope will often be damper than the steeper ground above and below them, for water collects there before flowing further downwards.

Ideally you should be near water, with a plentiful supply of wood near at hand. Pitching camp too close to water, however, may lead you to be troubled by insects, and the sound of running water can hide other noises which might indicate danger, or the sound of search or rescue parties.

On river banks look for the high water mark: in mountain regions streams can become torrents in minutes, rising as much as 5m (17ft) in an hour! Even on plains keep out of old watercourses, no matter how dry they are. Heavy rainfall in nearby hills can easily send water rushing down them in flash floods, with practically no warning. Choose ground that is reasonably flat and free of rocks and make sure that you have space to lay out signals and that you can be easily spotted by rescue parties.

Check above your head for bees’ or hornets’ nests and for dead wood in trees that could come crashing down in the next storm or high wind. Keep away from solitary trees, which attract lightning, and in forest areas keep to the edges, where you can see what is going on around you. Don’t camp across a game trail – you don’t want marauding animals as unwelcome guests or to find your bivouac flattened by a herd of animals on their way to a waterhole – but stay near to any obvious human tracks.

### Types of shelter

The type of shelter you build will depend upon local conditions and the materials available – and upon how long you expect to need it. For immediate protection from the elements, rig up a makeshift shelter while you construct something better and more permanent. If you decide to stay put and wait for rescue, a more long-term shelter can be built and improved on as time and energy permit.

For those walking to safety, on the other hand, temporary shelters can be built at each stopping point. They can even be carried with you if they are sufficiently light and there is a significant risk that suitable materials may not be available at the next campsite.

A more permanent shelter will certainly be worthwhile for the sick or injured, who must rest up in order to regain their strength, or where it is necessary to wait for the weather to clear before attempting a journey. Use the time to stockpile equipment and provisions.

#### Hasty shelters

If no materials are available for constructing a shelter make use of any cover and protection that is available: cliff overhangs, gradients and so forth, which will help shield you from wind or rain. Incorporate natural windbreaks in quickly constructed shelters. In completely open plains, sit with your back to the wind and pile any equipment behind you as a windbreak.

#### Bough shelters

Make use of branches that sweep down to the ground or boughs that have partly broken from the tree to give basic protection from the wind – but make sure that they are not so broken that they could come down on your head! Weave in other twigs to make the cover more dense. Conifers are more suited to this technique than broadleaved trees, as they require less weaving-in to keep out rain.

Make a similar shelter by lashing a broken-off bough to the base of another branch where it forks from the trunk (a).

#### Root shelter

The spreading roots and trapped earth at the base of a fallen tree make a good wind and storm barrier, if they are at the right angle to the wind. Filling in the sides between the extended roots will usually make the shelter much more effective, and provide a good support for building a more elaborate shelter from other materials.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image003.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
If you are stranded without shelter, a fallen tree can provide refuge from even the harshest and most unforgiving of climates.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Use a natural hollow

Even a shallow depression in the ground will provide some protection from wind and can reduce the effort in constructing a shelter. However, take measures to deflect the downhill flow of water around it, especially if it is a hollow on a slope, or you could find yourself Iying in a pool.

Make a roof to keep the rain off and the warmth in. A few strong branches placed across the hollow can support a light log laid over them, against which shorter boughs and sticks can be stacked to give pitch to the roof and so allow water to run off. Consolidate with turf or with twigs and leaves.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image004.webp" />

#### Fallen trunks

A log or fallen tree trunk makes a useful windbreak on its own, if it is at the right angle to the wind. With a small trunk, scoop out a hollow in the ground on the leeward side.

A log also makes an excellent support for a lean-to roof of boughs.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image005.webp" />

#### Drainage and ventilation

A run-off channel gouged from the earth around any shelter in which you are below, or lying directly on, ground level will help to keep the shelter dry. Hasty shelters will usually have many spaces where air can enter. Do not try to seal them all – ventilation is essential.

#### Stone barriers

A shelter is more comfortable if you can sit rather than lie in it, so increase its height by building a low wall of stones around your chosen hollow or shallow excavation. Caulk between the stones (especially the lowest layer) with turf and foliage mixed with mud, and deflect the flow of rainwater around the shelter as shown below.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image006.webp" />

#### Sapling shelter

If suitable sapling growth is available, select two lines of saplings, clear the ground between them of any obstructions and lash their tops together to form a support frame for sheeting. Weigh down the bottom edges of the sheeting with rocks or timber.

You can make a similar shelter from pliable branches driven into the ground.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image007.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
If you lack sheeting, choose or place saplings closer together, weave branches between them and consolidate with ferns and turf.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Tepees

Best known from its North American forms, the tepee occurs in many cultures. The quickest type to erect has three or more angled support poles, tied where they cross to make a cone. They can be tied on the ground and lifted into place before covering with hides, birch bark panels or sheeting. Leave an opening at the top for ventilation.

Wider angles will give greater area but shed rain less easily.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image008.webp" />

#### Parachute tepee

A parachute, suspended by its centre, makes an instant tepee. Peg out the bottom edge.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image009.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Parachute material can be used to cover a tepee, but even simpler is to suspend one from a tree. Give the sides a steep angle and, even when the fabric is not impervious, water will run off. Fold a segment of the chute double for a door flap, slit along a seam and make a tie fastening to close it.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Shelter sheet

With a waterproof poncho, groundsheet or a piece of plastic sheeting or canvas, you can quickly and easily make a number of different shelters which will suffice until you can build something more efficient. Make use of natural shelter (a) or make a triangular shelter with the apex pointing into the wind (b). Stake or weigh down edges. If it is long enough, curl the sheeting below you – running downhill so that it keeps out surface water (c). If you don’t have much material attach it so that you are shielded from the wind (c(i)). Use dry grass or bracken as bedding. Do not lie on cold or damp ground.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image010.webp" />

A closely woven fabric, though not impermeable, will keep out most rain if you set it at a steep angle. Fit one shelter a few inches within another (d). The rain that does come through will rarely work its way through both layers.

With any woven fabric, avoid touching the inner surface during rain or you will draw water through.

#### Stick walls and screens

It is easy to build walls by piling sticks between uprights driven into the ground and (if possible) tied at the top. Caulk them well to keep out wind and rain. These are ideal for making one side of a shelter, for blocking a shelter’s opening or for a heat reflector behind a fire. If large rocks are not available use this method to dam a stream.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
To make a very sturdy stick wall, increase the space between the uprights, use two stacks of sticks and, as you build it, fill the space between with earth.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Coverings

Make wattle and woven coverings for roofs or walls from springy saplings, plant stems, grasses and long leaves (either whole or, if large enough, shredded for tighter weaving). First make a framework from less pliable materials, either in situ or as a separate panel to attach later. Tie the main struts in position. Weave in the more pliant materials.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image013.webp" />

If no ties are available, drive vertical stakes into the ground and weave saplings between them. Caulk with earth and grasses.

If suitable firm cross-pieces are too few, weave creepers between the uprights.

Very large leaves, lashed or weighted down, or hooked over lines of creeper, can be overlapped like tiles or shingles to keep out rain.

</figure>

#### Open lean-to shelter

If there is nothing solid to lean a roof against and you are not trying to keep out heavy rain or a blizzard, use panels of wattle or frames covered in grass for protection.

Erect a horizontal cross-piece between trees or on simple supports (2). On the windward side lean a panel of wattle, or tie or lean saplings at 45 degrees to make a roof (3). Site your fire on the leeward side (6). Add side pieces and – this is the trick – build a reflector (8) on the other side of the fire to make sure that you get the full benefit of the warmth.

The lean-to on the opposite page shows the lean-to shelter taken to its logical conclusion. By adding to the left and to the right of the structure you can make the shelter larger and you can store more materials. To improve your shelter further you can add a canopy to the front of it in order to provide extra protection against the elements. This more advanced lean-to has space for fire wood (a), supplies (b), and includes a canopy (c).

#### Adding a canopy to the lean-to shelter

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image028.webp" />

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image029.webp" />

This requires two additional supports (one each side of the cross-piece placed at a 45 degree angle), and vertical supports on which to attach the covering material.

### Tropical shelter

In rainforests and tropical jungle the ground is damp and likely to be crawling with insect life, leeches and other undesirables. Instead of bedding down on the ground you will be better in a raised bed. Consequently you may want to make higher shelters.

Unless you are at an altitude high enough to make the nights cold, you will be less concerned with protection from the wind than with keeping reasonably dry. A thatching of palm, banana and other large leaves makes the best roofs and walls.

#### Atap

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image030.webp" />

Also known as ‘Wait-a-while vine’, atap is especially useful, despite the barbs at each leaf tip which make careful handling necessary. Look for any plant with a similar structure (a), the bigger the better. The broader the individual leaflets, the better also.

Atap is best used horizontally, splitting each leaf into two from the tip (b) then tearing it into two clean halves down its length. Do not try to split from the thick end or you will end up with a broken branch.

Closely layer halves of atap on your roof frame (c). You can let it be a little less dense on walls. Woven atap can be particularly effective for the sides of a shelter.

#### Another method

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image031.webp" />

Do not split down the leaf but fold the leaflets on one side across to the other and interweave them (d). You will probably find this easiest if you work first from one side then the other – but it does take practice.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image032.webp" />

Three-lobed leaves or leaves cut in this fashion (e) can be locked over a thatching frame without any other fixing being necessary to hold them in place (f).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image033.webp" />

Elephant grass and other large leaves can be woven between the cross-pieces (g). Only a small number are needed to produce a shelter very quickly.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image034.webp" />

Long broad leaves can be sown along the thatching battens with vines (h).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image035.webp" />

Palm and other long-stemmed leaves can be secured by carrying the stem around the batten and over the front of the leaf, where it is held in place by the next leaf (i). Leaves must overlap those below on the outside of the shelter.

#### Bamboo

This large-stemmed plant, actually a grass, is a very versatile building material and can be used for pole supports, flooring, roofing and walls.

The giant form of bamboo – which can be over 30m (100ft) high and 30cm (1ft) in diameter – is an Asian plant, found in damp places from India through to China both in the lowlands and on mountain slopes, but there are types native to Africa and Australia and two which are found in the southern United States.

:::warning

Take great care when collecting bamboo. It grows in clumps which are often a tangled mass. Some stems are under tension and when cut fly forcefully and dangerously apart, exploding into sharp slivers.

Split bamboo can be razor-sharp and cause serious injury. The husks at the base of bamboo stems carry small stinging hairs which cause severe skin irritations.

:::

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image036.webp" />

Split bamboo vertically to make roofing and guttering to collect rainwater. The split stems, laid alternately to interlock with one another, form efficient and waterproof pantiles.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image037.webp" />

Flatten split bamboo for smooth walls, floors or shelving by cutting vertically through the joints every 1.25cm (½in) or so around the circumference. It can then be smoothed out. The paper-like sheaths formed at the nodes can also be used as roofing material.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image038.webp" />

### Arctic shelter

In polar areas simple shelters will be those already waiting for you in natural caves and hollows. If you carry some kind of bivouac in your equipment, you can erect it and increase its protection by piling up loose snow around and over it, so long as it can support the weight. But to build in hard snow – and at very low temperatures snow will be solid – you need some kind of implement to cut into it or make blocks from it. Spades and ice saws are essential equipment for polar expeditions.

Snow or rock caves will be easily recognizable – but not so obvious are the spaces left beneath the spreading boughs of conifers in the northern forests when the snow has already built up around them.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image040.webp" />

A medium-sized tree may have a space right around the trunk (a) or a large one have pockets in the snow beneath a branch. Try digging under any tree with spreading branches on the lee side.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image041.webp" />

Even soft snow can be built into a windbreak. Those with equipment can cut blocks (b). This is the minimum shelter for the minimum effort. Anchor a ground sheet or poncho along the top with another course of blocks, use others to secure the bottom edge. Use more snow blocks to close the sides.

:::tip[building in snow]

A saw, knife, shovel or machete is necessary to cut compacted snow into blocks. The ideal snow will bear a man’s weight without much impression being made but be soft enough to allow a probe to be inserted evenly through it.

Cut blocks about 45 x 50cm (18 x 20in) and 10–20cm (4–8in) thick. These will be an easy size to handle, thick enough to provide good insulation and yet allow maximum penetration of the sun’s rays.

:::

:::info[surviving the cold]

No matter how low the external temperature, inside a well-constructed snow house the temperature will not drop lower than –10°C (0°F). Just burning a candle will raise the temperature by about four degrees. The traditional Eskimo way of heating the igloo was a wick in a bowl of fat. In a large shelter with a wood fire the temperature is cosy. An oil burner or fat on bones are  good alternatives where there is no wood.

:::

#### Snow trench

This is a much quicker shelter to construct than trying to build in snow above the ground, but it is suitable for only one person and then only for short-term use – while you are on the move or making something bigger, for example.

Mark out an area the size of a sleeping bag (including head support) and cut out blocks the whole width of the trench. Dig down to a depth of at least 60cm (2ft). Along the top of the sides of the trench cut a ledge about 15cm (6in) wide and the same deep.

Rest the snow bricks on each side of the ledge and lean them in against each other to form a roof (a). Put equipment below your sleeping bag so that you are not in direct contact with the snow beneath.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image042.webp" />

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image043.webp" />

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image044.webp" />

Block the windward end with another block or piled-up snow. At the other end (downwind) have a removable block as a door (b), or dig an entrance (c). Fill any gaps with snow. Most effective built on a slight slope. Cold air will collect in the entrance leaving warmer air in the sleeping space.

#### Snow cave

Dig into a drift of firm snow to make a comfortable shelter. Make use of the fact that hot air rises and heavier, cold air sinks. Create three levels inside: build a fire on the highest, sleep on the centre one and keep off the lower level which will trap the cold. Drive a hole through the roof to let out smoke and make another hole to ensure that you have adequate ventilation.

Use a block of snow as a door and keep it loose fitting and on the INSIDE so that it will not freeze up and jam. If it does, a block on the inside will be much easier to free.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image048.webp" />

#### Snow house (igloo)

An igloo takes time to construct but centuries of use by the Eskimo demonstrate its efficiency. Build the main shelter first then dig out an entrance or build an entry tunnel which is big enough to crawl along. Make sure that its entrance does not point into the wind. You could bend the tunnel or build a windbreak to make this less likely.

To construct an igloo by the circular method, mark out a circle on the ground about 4m (13¼ft) in diameter and tramp it down to consolidate the floor as you proceed with the rest of the building.  

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image049.webp" />

Cut and lay a circle of blocks on the perimeter. Be prepared to dig a tunnel (a), or leave a space for an entrance (b). Place another layer on top of them but, as when laying bricks, centre new blocks over the previous vertical joint.

Build up more layers but place each only halfway over the lower tier, so that the igloo tapers in or becomes dome-shaped. Shape out the entrance arch as you proceed. Seal the top with a flat block. Make ventilation holes near the top and near the bottom – not on the side of the prevailing wind or so low that snow rapidly builds up and blocks it. Fill any other gaps with snow. Smooth off all the inside to remove any drip-points. This will allow any condensation to run down the wall instead of dripping off.

#### Igloo (spiral method)

Lay the first course of blocks and then shape them to the required spiral. You do not have to overhang the blocks if you angle your initial spiral downwards and inwards, and shape the top and bottom faces of subsequent courses to lean inwards. The last few blocks in the centre may need some support as you fit them into position.

:::tip[living in a snow house]

- In bad weather make sure that you have a good supply of timber, or liquid fuel, inside the shelter.
- Do not carry loose snow into the shelter, knock it off boots and clothing before you enter.
- Mark the entrance clearly so that it is easily found.
- Keep shovels and tools inside the shelter – you may have to dig yourself out.
- Drips in igloos can be stopped by placing a piece of snow on the source.
- Relieve yourself inside the shelter – this is usual practice in these conditions and conserves body heat. Use plastic bags, ration tins or other containers and empty when possible. Try to discipline the bowels to work just prior to leaving the shelter in the morning and then remove faecal matter with other rubbish accumulated.
- In a shelter with several people organize a rosta of duties. It is important that someone tends the fire at all times. Others can check the vent holes, gather fuel, go hunting when possible, prepare meals and so forth.
- Remember that at a low temperature you will need more food.

:::

#### Inside the igloo

Cut an entrance way through the lower course of blocks or dig a tunnel beneath them. The central hole can be used as an entrance if you are too exhausted to complete the structure.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image054.webp" />

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image055.webp" />

Build a sleeping level higher than the floor (or dig down when building) to create a lower cold level which can be used for storage.

#### Parachute snow house

This is a useful structure if stranded on sea ice where sufficient snow for an igloo (or igloos) for a larger party may be hard to find. Look for snow or convenient blocks of ice in the pushed-up pressure ridges of the ice.

Mark out a circle and build up a circular wall of snow blocks about 1m (3ft) high. Leave an entrance space if on ice – you will not be able to dig an entrance tunnel. Dig a lower area in the floor for cold air to sink into.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image056.webp" />

Raise a central column of blocks in the centre about 1–1.5m (3–5ft) higher than the wall. Drape the parachute over this and the wall, securing it with a further row of blocks on top of the wall.

:::warning

The structure of this parachute roof makes it a snow trap, which could become a dangerous weight poised above your head. Clear accumulated snow regularly. If you want a small fire inside, ensure there is adequate ventilation. Site the fire on the outer shelf where it will not affect the canopy, not near the central column.

:::

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image057.webp" />

Anchor parachute cords with further blocks of ice or snow or cut a hole in the ice and pass the rope through it to make a firm anchorage.

### Long-term shelter

If you decide that any possible search for you has been abandoned and that it is impracticable to make your own way to safety, whether due to distance, time of year, lack of equipment or physical condition, you will want to make the most comfortable permanent shelter possible. Somewhere that you will be able to establish yourself cosily until you can eventually attract rescue or equip yourself to undertake the journey with your own resources.

In a cold climate you will want to be warm and snug. In a warm one, on the other hand, you will want to take advantage of any available breezes. Your shelter will need to provide protection against the changing seasons and night temperatures which may differ from daytime ones.

#### Caves

Caves are the most ready-made of shelters. Even a shallow cave (in stone usually known, in fact, as a rock shelter) offers an excellent temporary shelter and a larger cave can make an excellent permanent home. People still live in them in many parts of the world, sometimes with all modern conveniences! Caves situated above a valley will be dry even if water seeps through in some places from above. They are weather-proof and require little constructional work, usually simply the creation of a barrier to close off the entrance. Make this of rocks, wattle, logs, turves or almost any material.

Caves can be cold, and they may already be inhabited by wild animals, so approach any such shelter with caution. Plenty of dry plant matter and pine boughs on the ground will provide insulation.

A good fire will usually make animal occupants leave. Allow them an escape route.

Sometimes a cave will have its own fresh water supply, especially if it goes deep into a hillside, either from an underground stream or from water seeping through the rocks above.

:::warning

Check for the possibility of a rock fall inside or outside the cave. You might be desperate for shelter, but your situation will be a lot worse if you are trapped or injured by falling rocks.

:::

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image058.webp" />

If the cave faces into the wind, build a screen out from both sides, one slightly behind the other, overlapping them to provide an entrance (a).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image059.webp" />

Build the fire at the back of the cave. Smoke will go up to the roof, leaving air nearer the floor. Smoke from a fire near the open mouth of a cave will not escape outwards but will probably be blown in. If you seal the cave entrance make sure you leave a gap for the smoke to escape.

#### Light structures

Follow the methods outlined for the lean-to structure. You can extend it with a less angled roof and a front wall or you can build vertical walls and roof them over with deep eaves to give you extra shade from sun and to ensure that rain runs off well away from the hut. Dig a channel to carry any water away.

If you have bamboo or other strong material available to build a firm frame, raise the floor of your shelter off the ground in tropical climates, so reducing access to ground creatures.

In hot climates you will need to make your roof solid to keep out rain and give good protection from the sun but, if it projects well over the walls, you can leave them as fairly open lattice to allow air to pass through. Grasses and mud will seal cracks and all kinds of material will make a thatch if woven between roof cross-pieces of sticks or cords. In climates with heavy rainfall use leaves or bark like tiles on top.

#### Log cabin

Scale your cabin to the number it is to house. You can always enlarge it or add on extra rooms later. The size of logs available will determine the length of walls. A square or rectangle will be sturdy and easiest to roof – 2.5m (8ft) square is a sensible small size. You may be lucky and be able to use trees that have already fallen, in which case you could perhaps lash a framework of logs together and fill the spaces in between, but it is much better to joint the corners to fit snugly into each other. Do not finish off the projecting ends. These are the strength of the structure.

Build up the front higher than the back to give pitch to the roof. The last log front and back should project well beyond the side walls. These will support the roof. Across the hut from side to side notch in one cross-beam to keep short logs in place. Lay a roof of logs, front to back, extending beyond walls. Notch the logs to fit on to the cross-pieces or lash them down.

Choose a flat site for your cabin, or level a slightly larger area. Dig into a hillside if necessary, but the foundations for the walls must be level.

The flexible saw in your survival kit will cut logs of sufficient size, and if you are a survivor from a wrecked plane or boat there will have been a fire axe on board.

There is no need to make a door yet. Hang a piece of blanket to keep the wind out, or make a panel of wattle to fill the gap until you feel equipped to make a permanent door. Don’t bother with windows either – the doorway will give enough ventilation.

Caulk between the logs with mud and wood chips, or, if there are big gaps, saplings before applying the mud. Mix it with grass and moss, and use a sharpened stick to force it between the logs. Cover the roof with saplings before adding a layer of mud and turf.

If there is no risk of a build-up of water (in which case it would be useful to build a floor later) dig down inside the hut to provide the earth for mud caulking and you will at the same time increase its interior height.

If you leave a hole somewhere in the roof for smoke to escape, you can make a fire inside the hut. But do not leave it unattended – put it out rather than risk your home burning down.

If stone is readily available, you could build a proper chimney and fireplace. You’ll retain more of the heat if it is a central structure. Fit stones as closely as possible and use small stones and mud to pack the spaces.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image060.webp" />

:::tip[building a shelter]

The type of shelter you build will depend upon: the materials available, the tools available, what you are sheltering from (wind, COLD, SNOW, RAIN, INSECTS, and so forth).

How long do you intend to remain at the location? Snow caves and natural holes are ideal if you are on the move and do not need a permanent structure.

Size will depend upon the number in the party.

Take your time over building a complex structure and rest frequently. Over-exertion which produces sweating should be avoided.

All shelters MUST be adequately ventilated to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning and allow moisture to escape. Two holes are needed – have one near the top and one near the entrance. In snow shelters the holes must be regularly checked to ensure that they have not become blocked by snow or ice.

Regularly clear accumulated snow from any entrance tunnel to ensure that it does not become blocked.

The smaller the shelter the warmer it will be inside but, since it will not be possible to heat the shelter to many degrees above freezing, you will need a little time to adapt to the environment.

:::

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image061.webp" />

Lay down your first layer of logs in the shape of your hut (a). Joint the corners to fit on top of each other (b) and cut other logs to fit neatly on top.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image062.webp" />

Since logs tend to taper, place them alternately top to bottom to counter this (c).

Once the ground frame is established leave space for a doorway on the side away from the prevailing wind – you may be able to use off-cuts from logs for these sections on either side of the door. Square off the edges and wedge a door frame in place (d). Do not bother with windows, the door will give sufficient ventilation.

Instead of a complete roof of whole logs you could use lighter materials and mud on a timber frame. Bark from the logs makes an excellent top covering if laid as tiles. These could be pegged through with small supple twigs while the mud is still soft.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image063.webp" />

:::tip[survival scenario]

You have made your shelter, but where should you wash yourself and your clothes?

All ablutions should be carried out downstream. This will be at a lower point than where you are getting your drinking water from, therefore ensures your supply will remain clean / uncontaminated.

:::

## **Cooking**

> **When food is heated it loses nutritional value – the more the heat the greater the loss – so nothing should be cooked longer than is necessary to make it palatable unless it is suspect and being cooked to kill germs and parasites or to neutralize poisons.**

Boiling vegetables destroys their vitamin C content and roasting meat removes its all-important fat, but we are used to eating our food cooked and a hot meal is unsurpassed for raising morale. It would take great discipline to eat many things raw that you had not previously considered foods, but a frog, grubs or rats do not seem too bad once cooked.

Cooking not only makes many foods more appetizing to taste, see and smell, it softens the muscle fibres in meat, makes protein more easy to digest and – most important – it destroys bacteria and parasites that may be present.

If the ground is lush, animal foods are more likely to carry parasites. Pigs, especially, carry worms and flukes. Thorough boiling will destroy them, though at the loss of food value. Some foods must never be eaten raw – nettles and several other plants, for instance – but should always be cooked to neutralize harmful substances which they contain.

Your particular situation will determine whether to cook or not. If you cannot face eating something raw, or if food is plentiful but limited in type, cook it to make it more palatable. Relieve boredom by varying cooking instructions.

Cooking methods will depend upon the foodstuff and the facilities you have or can create. Type of fire, utensil support and cooking methods must all be matched.

Cooking requires a slow heat. Use the flame of a fire to boil water then let the fierce flames die down and use embers and hot ash for cooking.

**REMEMBER**: NEVER leave your fire unattended when cooking – you cannot afford to ruin food.

Once having lit a fire, ALWAYS have something boiling on it – unless water is in short supply – for hot water is always an asset: hot drinks are always cheering and you will find a multitude of uses from sterilizing wounds to making poultry plucking easier.

Do NOT just balance a can on the fire – if it tips over you could put your fire out, quite apart from losing its contents. Support vessels on firm rocks or suspend them over the fire.

#### Boiling

Cooking in boiling water requires a container. Tin cans and metal boxes are ideal. Make a handle, hang them from a pot support or use pot tongs to take them on and off the fire (see [Useful Utensils](#useful-utensils)). Puncture holes in pots can be repaired by hammering in small plugs of wood – when wet they will expand and stop leaks. If no metal containers are available, a thick length of bamboo holds liquids well. Containers can also be made from birch bark – but be careful that they do not boil dry.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image064.webp" />

To cook in a bamboo stem, angle it across the heat of the fire, supporting it on a forked stick driven into the ground.

Although boiling does destroy some food elements it conserves the natural juices and retains all the fat – provided that you drink all the liquid as well as eat the remaining solids. Each time you throw away cooking water you lose valuable nutrients, though you will have to discard it if boiling out toxic substances. Boiling will make tough and stringy roots and old game softer and more edible. It will kill worms and flukes and can even make spoiled meat fit to eat.

If you frighten a feeding animal from its kill, you can eat the remaining meat provided that you cut the meat up and boil it for at least 30 minutes. If desperate for food any dead animal that is not actually decomposing can be risked if you use only the large muscle areas. Cut them into 2.5cm (1in) cubes and then boil briskly for at least 30 minutes. Eat only a little, then wait for half an hour to see if there are any ill effects – most toxins affect the digestive system in that time or less. If there are no ill effects tuck in.

Part-boiling vegetables that you intend to cook by other means will speed up cooking times. (For boiling water when no fireproof containers are available see [Hangi Method](#hangi-method).)

#### Roasting

Roasted meat cooks in its own fat. The easiest method is to skewer the meat on a spit and turn it over the hot embers of a fire or beside a blazing fire where it is hot enough to cook. Continually turning the meat keeps the fat moving over the surface. Roasting makes a very tasty dish but has two disadvantages.

Valuable fat is lost unless a drip tray is placed beneath the spit. Regularly baste the meat with fat from the tray.

Roasting by a fierce fire can cook and seal the outside, the inner flesh remaining undercooked, leaving harmful bacteria alive. A slow roast is preferable, and if cooking continues after the outer meat has been cut off the inner flesh can go on cooking.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
When roasting fresh meat, skewer on a spit and slowly rotate over the hot embers of a fire or beside blazing flames. Be careful that the inner flesh is entirely cooked. If necessary remove the cooked outer meat and allow to continue roasting.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image066.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
The fire should be slightly to one side of food to allow for a drip tray to catch valuable fat.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Grilling

Grilling is a quick way of cooking large amounts of food but it requires a support – such as a mesh of wire – rested on rocks over the embers of the fire. It should only be used when food is plentiful since it wastes most of the fat from the meat. Hot rocks beside the fire can be used as grilling surfaces or food skewered on sticks and held over the fire.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image067.webp" />

If no wire mesh is available, make a grid of very green sticks or rest a long stick on a forked support so that it can hold food over the fire. Wrap food around the stick. You can also barbecue meat and vegetables on a stick supported across glowing embers by a forked stick on each side.

#### Baking

You need an oven for baking, but if time and materials are available this is a good way of cooking. Meat should be cooked on a dish and the fat which runs out used to baste it. It is ideal for tough, stringy meat. Cooked for a long time on a steady heat the meat becomes more tender. Baking is also very suitable for root vegetables.

If meat is placed in a tin containing a little water to be cooked in the oven this is a form of braising.

Use an oven to cook several different things at once.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image068.webp" />

Stand the tin on some rocks so that a fire can be lit beneath it. Build up rocks and earth – or, better, clay – around back and sides and over it, but leaving a space behind for heat and smoke to move around the back. Use a stick to make a chimney hole from above to the space at the back.

#### Steaming

Steaming does not overcook so preserves nutritional values. It is an excellent way of cooking fish and green vegetables. Fresh young leaves take very little cooking. The foodstuff needs to be suspended in the steam from boiling water.

#### Metal box oven

A large food tin or metal box with a hinged lid makes an excellent improvised oven. Army survivors found an ammunition box ideal. If the lid is hinged and has a catch on it that you can use as a handle, you could set it up to open sideways. It will probably be easier, especially if it has no catch or you have to improvise hinges, to let it open downwards. If you place a rock or other support in front, to rest it on, you will have a convenient shelf. You can always prop it closed if there is no catch, for you do not want a tightly sealed fit – which could build up dangerous pressure inside. If no tin or box is available you could make a clay dome, like an Indian tandoori oven. To make it hot set a fire inside and scrape this out before cooking. Leave a smallish aperture which can be easily sealed while baking.

#### Frying

Frying is an excellent way of varying diet, if fat is available and you have a container to fry in. Any sheet of metal that you can fashion into a curve or give a slight lip to will serve. In some areas, you may find a large leaf which contains enough oil not to dry out before the cooking is done – banana leaves are excellent surfaces to fry eggs upon. Try leaves out before you risk valuable food on them and, if you do use one, fry only over embers, not over flames.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image069.webp" />

Make a simple steamer by punching holes in a can and suspending it inside a larger can, or putting something in the bottom of the larger can to keep the inner one above the water. Cover the outer can so that steam is not dissipated, but not so tightly that it is sealed or pressure could build up and cause it to explode.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image070.webp" />

The compartmented sections of bamboo also make an excellent steamer. Make a comparatively small hole between the sections, but big enough to let water through to fill the bottom section. Make a lid (not too tight) for the top. Water boiled in the lowest section will produce steam to cook food in the top one.

#### Cooking in clay

Wrapping food in clay is a method that requires no utensils and offers a tasty alternative even when you have them. After wrapping in a ball of clay, food is placed in the embers of a fire. The heat radiates through the clay which protects the food so that it does not scorch or burn.

Animals must be cleaned and gutted first but need not be otherwise prepared: when the clay is removed a hedgehog’s spines or a fish’s scales will remain embedded in it. With small birds, the clay does your plucking for you – but feathers provide insulation and may prevent a big bird being properly cooked. Cooking root vegetables in this way will remove their skins – losing important food value.

#### Hangi method

This is another way of cooking without utensils. Like the clambake of the United States and traditional Maori and South Pacific methods it involves heating stones. It requires kindling, logs and round rocks or stones about the size of a fist. Do not use soft, porous or flaky stones which might explode on heating.

When the kindling is set alight the logs will burn, heating the stones above them, until, eventually, all falls down into the pit. Remove the burning embers and ash. Now, place food on top of the hot rocks, meat to the centre and vegetables towards the outer edge. There must be a gap between the food and the earth. Lay saplings across the pit and place sacking, leaves and so forth on top of them, covering the lot with the earth which you excavated to keep the heat in. The hole now acts rather like a pressure cooker. After 1½ hours remove the cover – your meal will be cooked.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image071.webp" />

Dig an oval-shaped hole with rounded sides 45–60cm deep (18–24in) and place kindling at the bottom. Lay logs across the hole, place another layer of logs at right angles to them, interspersing them with stones. Make another layer of logs and build up five or six more alternating layers, topping them off with stones.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image072.webp" />

#### Boiling water in a hangi

If you have no container in which to boil water you can make use of the hangi. Whatever you have collected water in, provided that it does not melt (so that rules out plastic but includes other kinds of waterproof fabric), can be gathered up and tied so that the water does not spill and placed in the hangi). It will take about 1½ hours to boil but the fabric will not burn through.

### Useful utensils

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image073.webp" />

#### Tongs

Choose two branches, both with a natural curve, and lash them together so that they want to spring apart at the free ends. Or use a tapering piece of wood between them under the lashings to hold them apart. If one has a forked end the grip will be improved. Use for holding pots, hot rocks and logs.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image074.webp" />

#### Pot rod

To give more variable access to the fire than a rail over it (a), drive a sturdy forked stick into the ground near the fire – but not so close as to catch alight. Rest a much longer stick across it with one end over the fire. Drive the bottom end of the longer stick into the ground and prevent it from springing up with heavy rocks. Cut a groove near the tip to prevent pots from slipping off, or – to be safer – tie on a strong hook.

Two or three sticks could lean over the fire at different heights with meat or vegetables attached.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image075.webp" />

#### Swinging pot holder

This can be made from two forked sticks and a firm upright driven into the ground. Bind the branches together so that the forks fit in opposite directions on the upright. The cantilever action will maintain the height you set it at, and a push sideways will swing the pot away from the flames. With a longer upright you could control cooking height also.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image076.webp" />

#### Variable pot hook

Since the distance between the fire and the food will affect the speed at which the food cooks, make this hanging device so that you can control your cooking.

Cut a strong piece with several branches from a small tree or bush and trim the branches to 10–12cm (4–5in). Strip off the bark, which may hide a rotten branch.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image077.webp" />

#### Bamboo cup

Cut a section of bamboo just below a natural joint and then cut just below the next joint up. Smooth the edges to prevent splinters.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image078.webp" />

#### Spoon

Start with a flattish piece of wood and scribe a spoon shape on it with the point of your knife. Then whittle away to the required shape. Do not hurry – this will only result in mistakes. Never cut towards yourself or your hand.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image079.webp" />

#### Birch bark containers

Use the inner layer of birch bark to make storage boxes or temporary cooking vessels – which can be used for boiling. Sew or tie them – near the top – to prevent unfolding. An alternative for temporary vessels is to peg the top edges with split sticks, but you might well spill the contents if the vessel suddenly unfolds. Make another vessel, but with a larger base, and you will have a lid to fit over the first.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image080.webp" />

A circle, folded into quarters, will make a cone-shaped cup – or a boiling vessel if suspended.

### Preserving food

If food is not plentiful or is likely to be limited by season, it is important to ensure that stores keep safely.

Micro-organisms, such as moulds, that spoil food, thrive in warm moist atmospheres. Deterioration can be delayed by keeping food in cool places such as caves or by water, but that is only a short-term measure. More positive action must be taken to ensure long-term preservation. The main methods to use are drying, smoking, pickling and salting. Sugar preserves will not keep for very long unless you can vacuum-seal them, but will keep longer than as soft fruit, and alcohol is an excellent preservative if you set up the facilities to make it.

#### Drying

Both wind and sun can dry food but, in most climates, it is easier to force-dry food over a fire. Losing moisture shrinks size and weight, concentrating the nutritional value. Many moulds can grow when there is as little as 16 per cent moisture content, but few can grow on foods with 5 per cent or less and these will also be less vulnerable to maggots.

Pork, geese, seabirds and other meat with a high fat content are the most difficult to preserve. It is best to cut off most of the fat and rub salt into the flesh. Salt is a good drying agent. Hang the salted meat in a cool airy place.

#### Smoke-drying

Smoking both dehydrates meat and coats it with a protective layer, like varnishing its surface. The inside is dry so no condensation takes place, and the outside is sealed against bacteria. Smoking can be best effected in a smoke house or a smoke tepee.

As an alternative to the tepee make a square frame of uprights and cross-pieces supporting a smoking platform with the fire beneath and used in exactly the same way as the tepee.

In both cases meat should be cut into lean, fat-free strips and fish gutted and filleted. The strips can be any length but should only be about 2.5cm (1in) wide and 6mm (¼in) thick.

Get a fire going to produce a pile of hot embers. Have a pile of green leaves ready. Leaves from hardwood trees are excellent, especially oak, but avoid holly and other toxic leaves and conifers which tend to be resinous and may burst into flame. Do not use grass. Some leaves will give meat an individual flavour; pimento leaves are particularly distinctive.

Make sure that there are no flames left in the fire and pile the leaves over the embers. Cover the whole structure with a cloth to keep in the smoke. If you do not have a suitable material, have boughs and turfs ready to pile rapidly on the frame and seal it. Leave the structure sealed for 18 hours ensuring that little or no smoke escapes.

#### Smoke tepee

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image081.webp" />

Drive three sticks into the ground to form a triangle and tie the tops together. Build a platform between them and get a fire going beneath. As an alternative to the tepee make a square frame of uprights and cross- pieces (a).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image082.webp" />

If the embers in a smoke tepee burst into flame, there is a risk that the whole structure may catch alight. This can be avoided by building a fire in a chamber in a bank (see [Snake Hole Fire](/sas-survival-guide/ssg-essentials#snake-hole-fire)) with the tepee erected over the chimney. This also makes it possible to tend the fire and to ensure a more extensive supply of smoke, which will be cooler than from a fire directly underneath. The food will dry slowly and become coated with smoke without being cooked.

#### Biltong

This is sun-dried meat. Biltong is the Afrikaans name, it is also known as jerky, from the North American Indian charqui. It does not keep as efficiently as smoked meat and should be used only when smoking is not practicable.

Cut strips, as for smoking, and hang them up in the sun. Make sure that they are out of the reach of animals and about 2–3m (6–10ft) from the ground.

It may take two weeks for meat to dry and all this time it must be kept dry, so protection from rain must be provided. The strips must be turned, if necessary, to make sure that all surfaces are thoroughly dried, and, initially at least, flies must be kept off so that they do not lay eggs on the meat.

</figure>

#### Drying fish

Preserve fish as biltong. Cut off heads and tails and gut. Split open. Remove backbone and lay on hot sun-baked rocks. Score inner flesh to speed up drying.

Small fish, under 7.5cm (3in) long need not be gutted.

Fish can also be smoked. They should be opened out, but it will be easier to hang if cleaned and gutted without removing the backbone, head or tail. Suspend by one side of the head.

#### Pemmican

This is a nutritious concentrated food made from biltong – excellent for provisions to carry with you if you decide it is time to trek to safety. It contains all essential minerals and vitamins except vitamin C.

You need an equal quantity, by weight, of biltong and of rendered fat. Shred and pound the meat. Melt the animal fat over a slow fire, without allowing it to boil. Pour the fat over the shredded biltong and mix them well together.

When cold pack the mixture in a waterproof bag. It will keep for a long time, especially in colder climates.

:::warning[be aware]

When you have taken time and trouble to preserve valuable foodstuffs, particularly in areas where food is scarce, take equal trouble in storing your food.

- Do not store in direct sunlight, near excessive warmth or moisture, nor where scavenging animals may ruin it.
- Wrap, where possible, in airtight and waterproof materials – or store in containers (such as birch-bark boxes) with a good seal. Label if you are storing several kinds of food and separate to avoid cross-flavouring.
- Check occasionally to see all is well.

:::

#### Pickling and salting

Citric acid obtained from wild limes and lemons can be used to pickle fish and meat. Dilute two parts of fruit juice with one of water, mix well and soak flesh in this for at least 12 hours. Now transfer it to a covered, and preferably airtight, container and with sufficient solution to cover all the meat. Vegetables with a high water content are difficult to preserve. Pickling is best for them. Alternatively, if salt is more easily available than citrus fruits, they can be boiled and then kept in brine (salt water). Boiling kills off bacteria and the brine keeps fresh bacteria away from the food.

The usual way of making sure that a brine solution is sufficiently strong is to add salt until a potato will float in it. In lieu of a potato try a small fruit or root vegetable which fails to float in salt-free water (not apples – they float too easily). Another method of using salt is to pack tightly layers of salt and vegetables such as beans and peas, thoroughly washing off the salt when you need to use them.

#### Nuts and cereals

These keep reasonably well provided they are not allowed to get damp but will keep better if dried. Place them on hot rocks from the fire, turning them frequently until thoroughly dried. They should then be kept in damp-proof containers.

#### Fruit, fungi and lichens

Fruit and berries can be dried whole or cut into slices and dried by sun, smoke or heat. Fungi also dry very readily – the Boletus species especially. Fruit can usually be eaten dry. Fungi can be added to soups and stews or soaked in water for several hours to regain some of their texture if being used in other ways.

To store lichens, soak them overnight, boil well and dry. Grind to a powder then boil again to form a thick syrup, which can be kept in a sealed container and used to give body to other foods.

### Cooking tips

#### Meat

Meat is best cut into small cubes and boiled. Pork is particularly suspect in hot climates: wild pig is usually infested with worm and liver fluke. Venison is also prone to worms.

Put excessively tough meat in a solution of juice from citric fruit for 24 hours. This marinading helps to make it more tender. Bring to boil and simmer until tender.

#### Offal

Check liver especially carefully. If firm, odourless and free from spots and hard lumps it can be eaten. Boil first, then fry if you wish. Hearts are best par-boiled then baked. Brain (if not used for preserving hides) makes an excellent stew. Skin the head and boil, simmering for 90 minutes. Strip all the flesh from the skull, including the eyes, tongue and ears.

#### Blood

Leave in the container in which it is collected but keep it covered. A clear liquid comes to the top. When separation seems complete drain it off. Dry the residue by the fire to form a firm cake. Use it to enrich soups and stews.

#### Sausages

Thoroughly clean intestines, turning them inside out to wash. Fill with a mix of half meat/half fat bound with enough blood to hold the ingredients together. Tie the ends and boil. Once cooked they can be preserved by cold smoking in a smoke tepee over a chimney.

#### Fish

Usually germ-free if caught in fresh water. Fish take little cooking and are best stewed or wrapped in leaves and placed in hot embers – chickweed and butterbur are good for this: avoid toxic leaves.

#### Birds

Boil all carrion. Old crows, blackbirds and parrots are tough and best boiled. Young specimens can be roasted – stuff the bird with herbs and fruits.

#### Reptiles

Best gutted and then cooked in their skins which are rough and leathery. Place in hot embers and turn continually. When the skin splits the meat can be removed and boiled. A few snakes have poisonous secretions on the skin and others may have venom glands in their head, so cut this off before cooking. If you are not sure whether they are safe, take care in handling them.

Skin frogs before cooking (many frogs have poisonous skins). Roast on a stick.

#### Turtles

Boil turtles and tortoises until the shell comes off. Cut up the meat and cook until tender.

#### Shark meat

Has a bad taste unless correctly cooked. Cut into small cubes and soak overnight in fresh water. Boil in several changes of water to get rid of the ammonia flavour.

#### Shellfish

Crabs, lobsters and shrimps, crayfish, prawns and so forth are safer boiled since they may contain harmful organisms. All seafood spoils quickly and must be cooked as soon as possible. Drop into boiling salted water and boil for ten minutes.

If you are sure the food is fresh, a clambake is a delicious way to prepare mussels, clams and similar creatures. Dig a hole in the sand and light a fire alongside with stones on top. When the stones are hot place them in the hole, put the shells on top and cover with wet seaweed or grass, then a 10cm (4in) layer of sand. The hole will develop a lot of steam which cooks the molluscs.

#### Insects and worms

Best boiled. Cook and mince them by crushing in a can.

More acceptable dried on hot rocks and then ground into a powder with which to enrich soups and stews.

#### Eggs

Boiling is the best way of cooking, but if no container is available roast after first using a sharpened stick or the very sharp point of a knife to pierce a small hole in one end. Place on warm embers to cook slowly. Slow cooking reduces the risk of cracking. Remember that banana leaves, which are full of oil, make an excellent frying pan. Place over hot embers and crack the egg onto the leaf. If a boiled egg contains an embryo chick remove the embryo and roast it.

#### Green vegetables

Wash in clean water and boil for just long enough to make them tender – they are often and easily overcooked. Tender plants can be gently steamed if you are sure that they are safe to eat. Add to stew after the meat is cooked and already tender. Eat fresh greens raw as salad.

#### Roots

Some are toxic but the toxins are destroyed by heat. Always cook roots; boiling will make the toughest ones tender. Roast roots are tasty – but boil them first. Try boiling for five minutes then place them in a hole dug beneath the fire, cover with ash and embers and leave until tender.

#### Lichens and mosses

Soak overnight in clean water. Add to stews.

#### Sago

Proper sago comes from the sago palm, but buri, sugar, fishtail and, in the American tropics, cabbage palms can be used in the same way. The average sago palm yields about 275kg (600lb) of sago – enough to feed one person for a year. Cut down the palm at the base of the trunk, trim off the tip just below the last flowering line. Divide a large trunk into sections.

Cut lengthwise – hard work, for the outer bark is 5cm (2in) thick and hard as bamboo. Using each section as a trough, pound pith into a mash, then knead in a container of water (the bole of the trunk will do) and strain through a cloth. A starchy paste will precipitate in the water. Roll this into sticky balls and cook.

#### Sap

Palm sap is extracted from flowering parts, not the trunk. Choose a fat stalk carrying a flowering head (at the base of the crown of the trunk). Bruise with a club to stimulate flow of sap, then cut off head. Sweet juice will flow from the end of the stalk – 1.5 litre (2½pt) per day. Bruise and cut daily to stimulate flow. Drink raw or boil then cool it to produce toffee-like lumps of almost pure sugar. Sugar, nipa, coconut and burl palms can all be used in this way. (Extracting resinous sap is dealt with under Trees in Food: Foraging.)

#### Grains and seeds

Grains are enclosed in a husk. Dry them thoroughly to allow the grain to crack out. Thresh (or thrash) it with a flail, stick or rock, or, if the grain is very malleable, rub it between your hands. Shake out on to a flat container and occasionally toss into the air in a breeze (winnowing). The husks (chaff) will blow away leaving the heavier seed behind.

#### Pinole

Parch husked seeds on hot stones by the fire. The heat will cook and dry seeds without roasting them. This pinole will keep well. Eat cold or reheat. Add to stews or place a handful in a mug of hot water – tasty and nutritious. Dry they will not be properly digested, but they will fill the belly. It is better to grind them into flour.

#### Flour

Grinding flour without a proper mill is hard work but can be done by pounding with a smooth stone on a hard surface. Look for a large stone with a depression in the middle to place the grain in. Use a circling action as with a mortar and pestle. Another way to grind flour is to hollow a tube of hardwood and to pound a stick up and down inside it on the grain.

Mix flour with a little water and knead into a dough. Bake in an oven or make into thin strips, wrap around a shaven green stick and cook over hot embers. Another method is to make the dough into fist-size balls, flatten them and then drop hot pebble-size stones into the centre and wrap the dough around them. Lick your fingers before picking up the pebbles – if you are quick the moisture stops the pebble from burning you – or use sticks or tongs (see [Useful Utensils](#useful-utensils)) to lift them.

Flour does not have to be made from cereal grains. Use the flowering heads of cat’s tails or boil and mash up peeled roots, of wild calla for instance, or edible barks. Those that are not harmful raw can be steeped in water and crushed with a stick or stone to free the starch. Remove fibres, leave starch to settle, then pour off the water and you will have your flour.


## **Organizing the camp**

> **In many survival situations there will already be someone in a position of responsibility who will head the organization of the camp and lead the development of survival plans. If no established command structure exists among a group of survivors, an organizing committee should be established and individuals nominated and elected with particular responsibilities, perhaps on a rotational basis if it is a large group and rescue does not come quickly. Experience must be pooled and immediate steps taken to discover what skills individuals can contribute.**

A roster is essential for such daily chores as collecting firewood and water, foraging, cooking, latrine-digging and maintenance tasks, and for hunting and trapping.

In a group of survivors there may be all kinds of people of different ages and experience. People will have varied skills and enjoy doing different tasks. Everyone who is fit and able should take their turn at the unpleasant tasks, unless their skills are so much in demand that it would be a waste of their abilities, but individuals should do what they are good at – and be encouraged to develop skills for which they show an aptitude.

Not only should everyone do their fair share but keeping busy eliminates boredom and keeps up morale. Anyone who is sick or injured gets the lightest jobs and is best employed around camp until they have recovered. In a group there should always be someone in camp, and they should be able enough to operate the signals should a search aircraft appear. If you have sufficient numbers do NOT venture from the camp in less than pairs.

Except in the desert, where the day will be largely spent sheltering from the sun and early morning and evening are the times for activity, daytime is likely to be fully occupied. Evenings, however, may drag if not occupied by hunting. A gathering around the camp fire will help establish a pattern and provide a sense of discipline and normality. It will give an opportunity to debrief on the day’s events, to plan for tomorrow and to discuss new strategies.

Music can be a great morale booster. If no instruments were carried or survived, simple ones such as percussion or pan-pipes can easily be improvised, and everyone can sing after a fashion.

Sing-songs, dancing, charades, quizzes and story-telling all have their place and you may have talents which can create more elaborate entertainments. For private recreation any books will be invaluable and you can make pieces for board games such as draughts and chess, using stones for counters or carving simple playing pieces.

Even the lone survivor requires discipline and order. A regular routine will help morale and exactly the same care must be taken to ensure that the camp is kept in good order. At first there may be so much to do that the individual is too tired to think of recreation, but boredom is even more dangerous for a person on their own and objectives should be set each day whether practical or for amusement.

:::info[camp discipline]

- Do not prepare game in camp: bleed, gut and skin on the trap line. This attracts game to the traps where you want them, not into your camp.
- Keep food covered and off the ground. If kept in trees make sure it is proof from tree-dwelling animals.
- Replace lids on water bottles and containers immediately after using them.
- Stow spare clothing and equipment in your shelter. Do not leave it lying where it can get wet or burned.
- Have a place for everything and keep things tidy: a tree for mess tins and cooking utensils – hook them on twigs and branches, a place for mugs and spoons – and keep everything off the ground. Fit a box as a cupboard on a tree trunk.
- Never leave the fire unattended.

### Camp hygiene

Keeping healthy is an important factor for survival, so strict hygiene should be practised, not only personally but in the planning and running of a camp. Rubbish and latrines must be kept away from the camp to reduce the threat from flies and, since most of the common diseases in a survival situation are water-borne, pollution of drinking water must be rigorously avoided. Food scraps and other rubbish should be burned in the fire if possible.

#### Camp layout

Select sites for all camp activities so that they do not interfere with each other or pollute the living and cooking areas. If you are camped by a river or stream, fix specific sections for activities and keep to them. Latrines should be dug downhill of the camp and away from the water supply so that there is no possible risk of seepage polluting either.

#### Activity areas

Establish a water point from which drinking water will be collected and ensure that no one washes, cleans pots, scrubs clothes or otherwise uses the stream upstream of this point. Downstream choose a wash point for personal ablutions and clothes washing and further downstream of that select a place to be used for cleaning cooking utensils.

Latrines and rubbish disposal should be well away from the camp – and preferably downwind – but not so far away that it is inconvenient and people are tempted to go elsewhere. If necessary cut a track to it to make access easier.

**REMEMBER**: NEVER urinate or defecate in or near your water supply.

#### Latrines and rubbish disposal

It is important that proper latrines be established, even for the lone survivor. With a group separate latrines for the sexes may make a mixed group feel more comfortable, and as much privacy as possible should be provided. Rubbish, after checking that it really has no useful value, should be burned, and what cannot be burned should be buried.

Even if you have it, do NOT use disinfectant in a latrine. Lime or disinfectants would kill the useful bacteria that break waste down and then it WILL start smelling! After defecating cover the faeces with earth. Add small amounts of water which will promote the bacteria.

Make a latrine cover to keep out flies and remember always to replace it, or flies that have walked all over faeces may walk all over your food and start a cycle of infection.

If, after a time, a latrine starts to smell, dig a new one. Fill in the old latrine. Build a new seat and burn old timbers and covers.

#### Deep trench latrine

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image089.webp" />

Dig a trench about 1.25m (4ft) deep and 45cm (18in) wide. Build up the sides with logs or rocks and earth to make a comfortable sitting height sealing the gaps between them. Lay logs across to leave only a hole for use (or several if you are a large group and making a communal latrine). Empty wood ash on the logs to make a seal – it will also deter flies.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image090.webp" />

Make a lid of smaller wood to cover the opening or use a large flat rock or a large leaf weighted down with stones. Always remember to replace it..

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image091.webp" />

#### Urinal

Dig a pit about 60cm (2ft) deep. Three-quarters fill it with large stones and then top up with earth, with a cone made from bark set into it as a funnel. Site it close enough to the camp to ensure that people bother to use it.

#### Incinerator

If there is too much waste for the camp fire to burn, make a separate fire in the latrine area. If a large can is available use it as an incinerator. Bury any unburned refuse in a garbage pit.

#### Soap

Washing with soap removes natural oils, leaving the skin less waterproof and more prone to attack by germs. In survival circumstances it is a mistake to wash with soap too often. However, soap is the most widely used antiseptic, better than many others, such as iodine, which destroy body tissue as well as germs. It is ideal for scrubbing hands before administering first-aid for wounds. Save supplies for this.

#### Soap-making

Two ingredients – an oil and alkali – are needed to make soap. The oil can be animal fat (including fish) or vegetable, but not mineral. The alkali can be produced by burning wood or seaweed to produce ash.

method: Wash ash with water. Strain and boil with the oil. Simmer until excess liquid is evaporated and allow to cool. This soap will clean the skin but is not antiseptic. Adding horseradish root or pine resin to the brew will make it antiseptic.

Experimentation will be necessary to get the balance in the mixture right. Start with more oil than alkali because too much alkali will dry the skin, leaving it sore.

## **Tools**

> **Before humans discovered metals, and learned to work them, tools were made from stone (especially flint, obsidian, quartz, chert and other glassy rocks), bone and other natural objects. Stones can make efficient hammers, alone or lashed onto a handle if in a shape that can be easily secured. The glassy stones can be knapped (chipped and flaked) to make a sharp edge; some other kinds of stone, such as slate, can also produce a knife edge, though they may not have the strength to be used for percussive blows.**

The best start for a stone implement is a split cobble, perhaps from a stream bed, or split by a blow from another smooth, hard pebble, so that a flat face is produced. The blow should be at an angle of less than 90 degrees or the shock will be absorbed within the pebble. Once the split is made, other layers can be broken off. Flakes can be removed around the edge of the flat face by hitting edge-on with another stone. Delicate work can be produced by hitting and pressing with a softer tool such as deer’s antler. If a flat face is produced, end-on blows can make thin blades.

Making stone implements is not a skill that can be quickly acquired and you may have to be very persistent.

Bones can be used as tools – antlers and horns make useful digging implements, gougers and hammers. They can also be cut with stone tools or ground with coarse stones. You may have the advantage over the prehistoric toolmakers, whose skills you are copying, of having a knife or other metal implement to help you to carve bone.

Some woods, such as the mulga tree of Australia, used by the Aborigines for spears, are hard enough to make effective blades for hunting and cutting.

#### Stone tools

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image092.webp" />

One technique for producing an axehead: First the stone is split and the edges partly shaped (a), then a platform is created on one side (b) from which a series of flakes can be struck vertically down (c).

The final shaping can then be done. Hit with softer stones, and hit and press small flakes away with a piece of antler or hard wood.

It may take a lot of patience to acquire tool-making skills but even practise flakes may be useful as scrapers, for cutting edges and as arrowheads.

#### Bone needle

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image093.webp" />

Choose a suitably sized bone or flake of bone and sharpen to a point. Burn an eye with a piece of hot wire, or lacking that, scrape with a knife point or piece of flint. DON’T heat the knife in the fire.

#### Bone tools

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image094.webp" />

A shoulder blade provides a good shape for an effective saw (a). First it should be split in half then teeth can be cut along it with a knife. A small bone scraper (b) could also be made, the edge ground sharp. Ribs are good bones for shaping into points (c).

#### Axes

A fire axe is part of the equipment of any boat or plane, but an axehead, to be fitted to an improvised handle, is a useful additional piece of equipment for anyone to carry. One of about 500–750g (1–1¾lb) is ideal. Use your knife to fashion a handle when needed.

#### Axe handle

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image095.webp" />

Any straight, knot-free hardwood is suitable – ash and hickory are ideal. In the tropics the flukes of a buttress tree (a) are excellent: slightly curved, straight-grained and easy to work. Cut two notches into the fluke of a buttress spaced to the desired handle length (b to c). Hit along the side of fluke close to the cuts. It will split away at their depth.

#### Fitting a stone axehead

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image096.webp" />

Select a hardwood handle. Tie a band of cord around it about 23cm (9in) from one end. Split the end down as far as this band (use your knife and a wedge or the piece of flint you have made for the axehead). Insert the flint and tie the end to secure.

This mounting will split wood but will not be very effective for chopping it.

#### Fitting the head

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image097.webp" />

Whittle the handle into shape with one end cut to fit the hole in the axehead, cutting a notch in that end. Make a wedge to fit the notch.

With the head in place drive in the notch then soak the axe in water overnight to tighten the head on the shaft.

Always check axeheads for tightness before using them.

#### Sharpening an axe

An axe with a blunt edge becomes no more than an inefficient hammer so keep it sharp, it will save energy. A file is best for getting rid of burrs, and a whetstone for imparting the sharp edge. A file is a one-way tool – it works when pushed, not pulled.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image098.webp" />

Prop axehead between a log and a peg (a). Always try to sharpen INWARDS from cutting edge to avoid producing burrs.

Use a file or rougher stone first to remove rucks and burrs (b). Then finish with a smoother stone, using a circular motion (c). Don’t drag the stone off the cutting edge. Push ONTO blade. (See [Knives](/sas-survival-guide/ssg-essentials#knives)).

Turn the axe over. Repeat the process circling in the opposite direction.

#### Using an axe

Most people have a natural prime hand and swing. Use an axe in a way that is comfortable to you, swinging it in an arc that feels natural with a firm grip and ALWAYS away from your body, hands, and legs. Make sure that, if you miss the tree or other point of aim and follow through, the axe will not strike you or anyone else. NEVER throw an axe on the ground. Sheath it or bury the blade in a log.

#### Tree felling

Check overhead for dead branches, which may fall and injure you, and for hornets’ nests. Clear branches or creepers which could deflect your blows. If roots or the bole spread out at the bottom, build a platform to reach a thinner diameter trunk and reduce the effort of chopping. Ensure such a platform is stable and that you can jump off it quickly if the tree falls the wrong way!

Work at a comfortable height and try to cut downwards at 45 degrees, although every now and then a horizontal blow is needed to clear the cut.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image099.webp" />

Cut from both sides of the tree, first chopping out a notch at an angle of about 45 degrees and another on the opposite side at a lower level, ON THE SIDE TO WHICH YOU WANT THE TREE TO FALL (a). Do not cut through more than half the tree before starting the other notch.

If two people are at work on opposite sides this is particularly important. A leaning trunk or a tree with most of its branches on one side will fall in the direction of its weight and the placing of the cuts will not affect it.

A steady rhythm of blows will cut more effectively than trying to make fewer big blows. If you put too much effort behind the axe your aim will suffer and you will soon tire. Let the weight of the axe do the work.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image100.webp" />

Alternating the angle of stroke will prevent the axe from jamming. Too steep an angle will cause the axe to glance off the trunk (a). Dead-on will make it jam or be inefficient (b). Aim for 45 degrees (c).

#### Splitting logs

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image101.webp" />

Stand behind a large log with feet well apart. Swing down to cut the side away from you (a).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image102.webp" />

Do NOT chop downwards (b).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image103.webp" />

To split a smaller log, angle against another log (c). DO NOT PUT YOUR FOOT ON IT.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image104.webp" />

Alternatively, hold smaller log against cutting edge of axe and bring both down together (d) on to a larger log. (Not to be tried holding too short a log for safety.)

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image105.webp" />

If in doubt split larger logs with a wedge and a rock (e). DO NOT HOLD WOOD UPRIGHT IN YOUR HAND AND ATTEMPT TO SPLIT WITH AXE.

#### To remove branches

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image106.webp" />

Cut off branches from the outside of the fork (a), not the inside (b).

#### Broken handles

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image107.webp" />

Using an axe takes practice and while gaining experience axe handles often get broken – usually because the head misses the target and the handle takes all the blow (a). To remove a broken handle, the easiest way is to put it in a fire, burying as much as possible of the metal in the earth to prevent it losing temper – single-headed (b), double-headed (c).

#### Using a flexible saw

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image108.webp" />

Always use a flexible saw so that the cut opens up (a) rather than closes tight (b) on the saw, causing it to jam. Do not pull too hard or the saw may break.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image109.webp" />

At all times keep the wire taut (c) pulling in a straight line, never at angles (d).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image110.webp" />

With two people the rhythm must be carefully maintained. If a kink is produced in the saw (e) it may break.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image111.webp" />

It is usually easier for a single person to cut a log by pulling upwards (f). Support the log to keep it off the ground and give it an angle to keep the cut open.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image112.webp" />

Alternatively, to remove a branch, pull down from above the head (g). This could be dangerous.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image113.webp" />

Very high branches can be removed by attaching strings to the saw toggles to give extra reach. This is dangerous. Keep your eye on the branch and be prepared to jump out of the way.

## **Furnishing the camp**

> **Sleep is the great regenerator and a comfortable bed is worth a little effort. Some form of bedding should always be used to avoid lying directly on cold or damp ground. In tropical climates it is always better to raise the bed into the air, both to keep off wet earth and to provide a current of cooling air. In cold climates, when no permanent shelter has been erected, choose fuel which will keep the fire going through the night and build a screen to reflect heat back on to your sleeping space.**

When the ground is dry, or under shelter, stones heated in the fire (but see [Warning](/sas-survival-guide/ssg-essentials#tinder)) and then buried under a thin layer of soil beneath the bedding will keep their heat through most of the night, adding to your comfort.

### Beds

#### A-frame beds

An A-frame forms a strong construction and will keep you off the ground. Drive two pairs of posts into the ground at an angle, leaving a little more than your height between the pairs. Lash the tops together. If the ground is hard, cross-members will be needed between the feet of each A-frame and between the two A-frames.

#### Tube bed

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image114.webp" />

This simplest form depends on having or making a tube of strong material, sewn or thonged together. A large heavy-duty plastic bag is suitable, but not thin plastic. Really toughly made clothing could serve but would usually make a rather narrow bed.

Do not risk this method with any fabric that might give under your weight or with seams that might come apart.

Make A-frame supports and choose two fairly straight poles, each slightly longer than the distance between the frames, and pass them through the tube of plastic or fabric. Place them over the frames so that they rest on the sides, the tube preventing them from slipping lower.

#### Bough bed

Where conifers are growing, fir tree branches arranged in alternate layers will be comfortable and their fragrance will ensure a good night’s sleep.

#### Ladder bed

Make A-frame supports and select poles as for the tube bed, but you will also need a number of cross-pieces – how many will depend upon the size of the sleeper and the kind of bedding to be used. Springy saplings will be more comfortable than boughs, provided they are strong.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image115.webp" />

Lash the end ‘rungs’ to the A-frames, jutting out either side. Make these of strong timber and lash them securely. Fit the ladder over the frames and lash in place. Lay bedding of bracken, ferns or leaves.

#### Hammocks

It takes a little practice to sleep in a hammock – in a string one you must push the sides outwards so that it cups around you.

#### Para-hammock

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image116.webp" />

It is possible to make a hammock from a parachute. The rigging lines run through the fabric right up to the apex. Cut five panels as shown but do not cut the rigging lines above.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image117.webp" />

Overlay the panels as shown (a) and flatten out.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image118.webp" />

Grasp the three rigging lines in the corner and tie, close to the fabric, in an overhand knot (b).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image119.webp" />

Then plait the three lines together (c) (see [Knots](#knots)).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image120.webp" />

Insert spacer bars, notched at each end (d) to take the lines and tie your hammock to two convenient trees or stout posts.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image121.webp" />

If you rig a line over the hammock (e) you could drape a groundsheet or poncho over you to form a quick shelter. If you do this be sure one end of the hammock is secured with a quick-release knot (see [Knots](#knots)). It might be necessary to get out of the hammock in an emergency.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image122.webp" />

If you have another piece of rope, or plait some from unused rigging lines, you could tie both the hammock strings to a fixed loop, such as a bowline (see [Knots](#knots)). Experiment with different ways of suspending your hammock, until you find the most stable and comfortable.

#### Seats

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image123.webp" />

Never sit on damp ground. Use something, even if it is only a log. If there is no ready-made seat available, lash together a couple of low A-frame supports and rest another bough across them.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image124.webp" />

Make a simple box frame with cross-members linking legs from short lengths of wood. To make a seat: weave vines or twine back and forth or sew on a piece of canvas or plastic with thongs. Failing these, try a flat piece of wood or metal laid across, or thin springy saplings lashed to the frame and interwoven.

#### Ladder

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image125.webp" />

Food-collecting, shelter-building, trap-setting and a whole lot of other tasks will be easier with a ladder. This one is easily made by lashing cross-pieces to two long poles. Because these are set at an angle, not parallel, the rungs will not be able to slip down.

#### Travois

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image126.webp" />

For bringing fuel or your prepared kill back to camp, or for other loads, a travois will work if the ground is fairly smooth – it will not on rough and boulder-strewn terrain. Choose two boughs with some spring to them and lash cross-pieces, as for the ladder. Add additional struts to provide closer support.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image127.webp" />

Pull the load on its ‘runners’ like a sled. If you are pulling loads over a short distance, lash the runners to come to a single grip (a). For a larger version leave the last space clear or fit leather or fabric shoulder straps to haul it by (b).

(For carrying equipment and sledges see [On the Move](#on-the-move)).

## **Animal products**

All animals provide skins. Their condition will depend on how carefully they were removed, the way the animal was killed (which may have damaged the skin), the age of the animal and time of year (Mating season, moult and change of season can affect the amount and colour of fur in some species). Common defects are due to parasites, disease, malnutrition and scars from fight injuries.

### Skins and furs

Snakes, lizards, crocodiles and other reptiles all provide excellent skins. So do large birds such as ostriches. Some aquatic mammals, seals and their relations, are fur-bearing, like land mammals, and whales and dolphins have strong hides. Sharks also have a hide, instead of scales like most other fish. Birds can be skinned with the feathers attached and used to make warm clothing or bed covers. Skin is a source of food and in circumstances of acute shortage can be eaten, even after being preserved and used for clothing, but it is very tough and takes a lot of digesting. There are cases of people surviving by eating their boots, though it should be emphasized that in all such cases plentiful water was available.

Skins and hides are composed of water and proteins and decay quickly if they are not specially treated to preserve them. How they are treated will depend upon whether you want to retain the hair or fur, but the initial stages will be the same in both. To make moccasins, shelters, laces, thongs, water bags or canoes, the hair is removed, but for warm clothing, bedding or a good insulating groundsheet it should be left on.

Properly prepared skins will be supple, yet strong, and resist tearing, abrasions, deformation or stretching. They are comfortable to wear, with good thermal insulation, but permeable to air and water vapour.

#### Cleaning the skin

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image128.webp" />

Make cleaning and drying a skin easier by stretching it on a frame. Do not make the holes for the cords too close to the edge. Remove fat and flesh by scraping the skin, using an edge of bone, flint or other rock, or even wood. Take care not to cut the skin. Remove every trace of flesh. Ants and other insects may help you if you lay the skin on the ground. Keep watch that they do not start to consume the skin itself.

#### To cure furs

Stretch the skin as tight as possible and leave it in the sun to dry out. All the moisture must be drawn from it so that it will not rot. Rubbing salt or wood ash into the skin will aid the process.

Do not let the skin get wet, or even damp, until the process is complete. Do not leave it where it will be exposed to rain or risk a covering with morning dew.

Keep it absolutely dry. If little or no sun is available, force-dry over a fire, but keep the skin out of the flames and use only the heat and the smoke (which will aid preservation). Keep it away from the steam from any cooking pots.

#### Leather-making

After cleaning, place the skin in water and weight it down with stones. Leave it until the fur can be pulled out in handfuls – usually 2–3 days.

Make a mixture of animal fat and brains, simmered over a fire till they form an even consistency.

Scrape the skin on both sides, removing hair, and grain. Keep it wet. Work sitting down with the skin over your knees. Keep manipulating it.

Work the fat and brains mixture into the inner side of the still-wet skin, stretching and manipulating as you do so.

Dry the skin in the smoke over a fire, keeping it well away from the flames. The smoke sets up a reaction with the solution you have rubbed in to make the skin supple.

#### Sinew as thread

The hamstring and the main sinews of the legs – especially of the larger animals – can be dried and used as thread to stitch hides together for shelter and clothing. Recognize them by their strong, white, cord-like appearance.

You can also use them for bowstrings and short ropes. They make excellent bindings for arrowheads. Sticky when wet, they dry hard.

#### Bladder

The normal function of the bladder is to hold water, so naturally the bladder of a large animal can be used as a water carrier – so can the stomach. Tie off the openings to seal them.

### Clothing

When inadequately or unsuitably clothed for the situation you can improvise or supplement protection in many ways. Weaving fibres will only be practicable in a long-term situation and skins will not be available at first. Salvage towels, blankets, tablecloths, cushions, seat-covers, curtains, sacking from the wreckage – with a bit of initiative any kind of fabric can be used for garments, bedding or shelter.

Improve insulation and increase warmth by adding layers. Wear one sock on top of another and stuff dry grass or moss between them. Grass, paper, feathers, animal hair, etc, can be stuffed between other layers of clothing – newspapers give excellent insulation.

#### Waterproofing

Use plastic bags and sheets to improvise waterproofs or cut off large sections of birch bark. Discard the outer bark and insert the soft and pliable inner layer under the outer clothing. It will turn away much of the rain. Other smooth barks that peel easily can be used, but birch is best.

In the longer term, improve water-repellent qualities by rubbing animal fat or the tallow from suet into your clothing. Do NOT do this in situations of intense cold, where the reduction in insulation would be too great a loss and rain rarely a threat.

#### Footwear

Never underestimate the heavy wear and tear of rough ground on your feet. Climbing over rock and scree can soon destroy a pair of smart city shoes. High heels and sandals will soon break or wear in rough conditions.

– Cut shoe soles from rubber tyres, make holes around the edges for thongs to tie them over wrapped feet, or to sew on to fabric uppers.

– Several layers of wrapping are better than one on the feet. Tie on with thongs or use a triangular shape. Fold one point back over toes, make slits in front. Bring other points from behind the heel, through slits and tie around ankle.

– Moccasins can be cut from a single piece of leather, about 8cm (3in) bigger all round than the actual sole of your foot. Thong in and out around the edges and gather them in over wrapped feet. Tie off the gathering thongs, and weave another back and forth over the foot to make more secure. Alternatively, given more time and patience, more traditional moccasins can be made from a thickish hide sole, side strips and an upper. Measure around your foot first.

#### Goggles

To protect from glare at sea and in snow or desert cut a strip of material, paper, bark – but not metal – to tie over the eyes (or over the whole face in cold climates). Eskimos often carved goggles from wood. Make narrow slits for the eyes. Add extra protection by blackening beneath the eyes with charcoal to reduce glare.

#### Needle and thread

The Agave plant produces fibres for ropes and mats that are too rough for clothing but the end of the leaf is almost always a hard point which can be extracted with a fibre attached. It makes a perfectly threaded needle!

#### Clothing tips

– Tie long leaf strips and fibres around a belt or neck band to hang down as a ‘grass’ skirt or cape.

– Cut a head hole in a blanket or carpet and use as a poncho. Tie at waist or thong sides.

– Small skins are easily thonged or sewn together. Fur on the inside will give greater insulation but on outer garments the suede side sheds snow better.

#### Laces and lashings

Hide is one of the best materials for lashings and for thongs to lace things together.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image129.webp" />

Cut short laces straight from the skin, along its length.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image130.webp" />

To obtain a greater length cut in a spiral – keep the width consistent or the thonging will have weak points.

## **Ropes and lines**

There are thousands of uses for ropes and line, from securing constructional joints to making candle wicks, for rappelling down a cliff face to making snares and nets. Traditional materials for rope include hemp, coir (coconut fibre), Manila hemp (from the Abaca plant), henequin and sisal (both from species of Agave).

Rope can be made from any pliable, fibrous material producing strands of sufficient length and strength. Much modern rope is made from nylon and other man-made fibres. They have the advantage of great inherent strength, lightness, resistance to water, insects and rot. However, nylon rope should not be the automatic choice if choosing equipment.

Nylon has the disadvantage that it can melt if subjected to heat – and friction on a rope produces heat. It is also slippery when wet. While its tensile strength is good, nylon also tends to snap if subjected to tension over an edge – it does not have to be a very sharp edge.

#### Choosing rope

Match type, thickness and length of rope you carry to the demands you expect to make on it. Nylon will have advantages in very damp climates and when weight is critical but remember its drawbacks. Thicknesses of 7mm (5/16in) and below are difficult to handle.

Rope about 9–10mm (3/8in) is usually recommended for lashings, throwing and mountaineering. It can be used for safety lines and for climbing, provided belay and abseiling techniques are used – it is not thick enough for a hand-over-hand and foot grip. A length of 30–40m (100–125ft) would then be as much as can be carried without encumbrance.

Climbing rope must be elastic, to absorb some of the shock, without putting enormous strain on anyone who falls. See if it has the approval of official mountaineering bodies or conforms to the British Standard 3184 (for hawser-laid ropes).

#### Types of rope

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image131.webp" />

Kernmantel type (a) encloses a central core of strands in an outer sheath. Easier to handle, except when wet or icy, but not so strong as hawser. It can unravel if cut. Traditional hawser-laid rope (b) has three bundles of fibres twisted together. If one is severed the others may hold.

#### Taking care of rope

Rope should be protected from unnecessary exposure to damp or strong sunlight and (in the case of natural fibres) from attack by rodents and insects.

If it does get wet, do not force-dry it in front of a fire. Do not unnecessarily drag it along or leave it on the ground. Dirt can penetrate and particles of grit work away at the fibres from inside the rope. If weather conditions will make drying possible, it is worth trying to wash a very dirty rope in clean water.

Try to keep a rope for the job for which it was intended – do not use climbing rope as clothesline or lashing if you can avoid it – though in a survival situation you may have to use the same length for many purposes.

Whipping the end of the rope (shown later) will prevent it fraying. To prevent a rope becoming tangled, store and carry it in a coil or skein. It will be easier to handle and to pay out when needed.

Rope is valuable equipment. You may have to trust your life to it. Do your best to keep it in good condition.

#### Throwing a rope

It is easier to throw a coil of rope than to attempt to sling a loose end – whether you are throwing upwards or outwards – and it helps to split the coil so that it doesn’t tangle. Have a large knot or weight on the throwing end. Make sure that you keep hold of the other end!

Think about the anchored end and what will happen to it when the other end reaches its target. If throwing a lifeline, for example to a fast-moving raft on water, are you going to be pulled into the water yourself? Anchor the end to a tree or weight. Always over-throw a lifeline so that the recipient stands a good chance of catching part of the rope, even if they miss the end.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image132.webp" />

Coil half the rope on to the fingers and palm of the right hand, then raise the index finger and coil the remainder on to the other fingers only. Pass the second coil back to the left hand.

As you throw, release the right-hand coil a split second before the left. Anchor your end if you think there will be sudden strain on it and your position is precarious.

#### For a long throw

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image133.webp" />

Tie a suitable missile to the end of the rope (a). Coil the rope carefully on the ground or loop it loosely over the other hand so that it will pay out freely as you throw the missile.

Don’t risk loosing your end of the rope. Tie that to an anchor, a heavy stone for instance. Use a killick hitch (shown later).

If throwing a weighted rope over a branch keep out of its path as it swings back towards the throwing point! If throwing a lifeline don’t knock out the person that you are trying to help!

#### Simple coil

</figure>

#### For longer ropes

If you wish to carry long ropes over your shoulder or suspended from a belt or from your pack, form a skein.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image138.webp" />

Loop the rope backwards and forwards over your arm, letting it hang down about 45–60cm (18–24in) long. Leave the ends free (a). Take both ends together and wrap them several times around the skein (b).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image139.webp" />

Make a loop and take this through the top part of the skein (c) and, finally, pass the ends through this loop (d). Now tie off on to your pack with a reef knot.

### Rope-making

Vines, grasses, rushes, barks, palms and animal hairs can all be used to make rope or line. The tendons from animals’ legs also make good strings, but they tend to dry hard (very useful for binding on arrow and spear heads).

The stems of nettles make first-class ropes and those of honeysuckle can be twisted together to make light lashings. The stronger the fibre, the stronger the rope. Some stiff fibres can be made flexible by steaming or by warming.

While pliable vines and other long plant stems can often be used as they are, for short-term purposes, they may become brittle as they dry out. A rope made from plant fibres twisted (‘spun’) or plaited together will be more durable.

#### Sources of fibres

– Nettles (Urtica dioica) are an excellent source of fibres but require preparation.

Choose the oldest available plants and those with the longest stems. Soak them in water for 24 hours, then lay them on the ground and pound them with a smooth stone. This will shred the outer surface exposing the fibrous centre. Tease and comb to remove fleshy matter. Hang to dry. When dry, remove and discard the outer layer. ‘Spin’ fibres into long threads, plaiting or twisting together to make a strong rope.

– Palms usually provide a good fibre. Leaves, trunks and stalks can all be used. The husk of coconut is used commercially to make ropes and matting.

– Dogbane (Appocynam cannaninum) stems also provide very good fibre, with which it is easy to work.

– Barks Willow bark especially produces very good fibre. Use the new growth from young trees. The dead inner bark of fallen trees and tree branches should not be overlooked. But if the tree has been down too long it may have decayed too much, so test it for strength.

– Roots The surface roots of many trees make good lashings. Those that run just under, or even on the surface, are often pliable and strong. The roots of the spruce are very strong. The Indians of North America used them to sew birch bark together to make canoes.

– Leaves Plants such as those of the lily family, especially aloes, have very fibrous leaves. Test by tearing one apart. If it separates into stringy layers it can provide fibres to make into rope. Soak to remove the fleshy parts.

– Rushes, sedges and grasses should be used when still green. Pick the longest specimens available.

– Animal tendons are useful for tying one thing to another. They must be used wet.

#### Splitting canes

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image140.webp" />

Bamboo, rattan, and other types of canes, vines and bark all need to be split to be used for any kind of rope-making. If you try to pull away thin strips, these tend to run away to nothing. To avoid this problem pull on the thick part to separate it from the thin. It saves both time and energy.

#### Testing fibres

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image141.webp" />

Tie two lengths together using an overhand knot – shown later. Try pulling it apart, using a reasonable amount of strength. If it snaps the fibre is too brittle. If it is too smooth, it will slip apart. Suitable fibre will ‘bite’ and hold together.

#### Plaiting rope

An easy method for the less experienced is to twist and plait strands. If you make three thin plaits, these can then be plaited together again for a thicker, stronger rope. If you are lengthening the strands as you plait, stagger the places at which you feed in new fibres.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image142.webp" />

Take a bundle of fibres, tie the ends together, anchor it firmly and split into three separate strands (a). Bring the left strand into the centre (b), then the right over it (c). Then bring what is now the left strand to the centre (d) and so on (e–f). Keep twisting the strands and keep the plaiting as tight and even as you can make it.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image143.webp" />

#### Spinning a rope

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image144.webp" />

Twist fibres together (shown here clockwise, but what is important is to keep to the same direction). Feed in lengths of new fibres as you go so that their ends are staggered.

When you have produced three lengths of fibre, anchor all three at one end and continue to twist each of them until quite tight. Temporarily fastening a toggle to the end of each will make twisting easier.

Now draw all three strands together and twist all three anti-clockwise – the opposite direction.

Continue to add and twist until you have produced the amount of rope you need. You will need to secure a completed section in a cleft stick to keep it tight as you work. Wrap the rope around a tree trunk, to keep the working length short.

To make a thicker rope repeat the process with three ‘ropes’ you have already made or plait three simple ropes together.

**REMEMBER**: When making rope try to keep the thickness of the strands equal and even along their lengths. It is where a lay has a thin section that the rope is most likely to break.

#### Whipping ropes

The end of a rope must be secured in some way so that it does not unravel. To prevent the strands from fraying, bind the rope with twine.

Good binding, or ‘whipping’, MUST be tight and neat to be effective. If it is too slack it will work loose or fall off. It is difficult to make good whippings with thick cord and very thin is prone to slip. Experience will enable you to match the thickness to the job.

Use the whipping technique to add a comfortable grip to the handles of axes and parangs or, thicker, to replace the handle of a knife.

Knots
-----

There is a knot for every job and it is important to select the right one for the task in hand. You never know when you may need to tie a knot so learn their uses, and how to tie each one – well enough to tie them in the dark and under all kinds of conditions. Learn to untie them too – the only thing that is worse than tying a knot that comes undone is a knot that CANNOT be undone at a crucial moment.

In the instructions for individual knots that follow, the end of the rope or cord being used to tie the knot is referred to as the ‘live end’ to distinguish it from the other end of the rope, or ‘standing part’.

#### Reef knot

Also known as the square knot, this is perhaps the best known of all knots. It is used for tying rope of the same thickness and will hold firm even under strain, yet may be fairly easily untied.

It is NOT reliable for ropes of different diameters, nor should it be used with nylon – it will slip.

Reef knots can be tied in other materials – it is a good knot to use in first aid. It will lie flat against the patient.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots01.webp" />

Pass the LEFT end over the RIGHT and then under it.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots02.webp" />

Then take the RIGHT over the LEFT and under it.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots03.webp" />

Check it - the two loops should slide on each other. If you have crossed the wrong way you will have a granny, which may not hold and is difficult to untie if subjected to strain.

Tighten by pulling both the strands on each side, or just the live ends, but be sure it tightens properly.  
  
To be doubly sure, you can finish off the knot by making a half-hitch with the live ends on either side of the knot.

### Simple knots

These are some of the simplest knots. They are quickly made, and studying them will help you understand some of the more complicated knots that follow.

#### Overhand knot

The simplest of all knots.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image150.webp" />

Make a loop and pass the live end back through it. It has little purpose on its own except to make an end-stop on a rope, but it is part of many other knots.

#### Overhand loop

A very quickly made knot for throwing over a projection. The loop is fixed and cannot be tightened so the projection must point away from the direction of strain.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image151.webp" />

Double the end of the rope and tie an overhand knot with the loop.

#### Figure-of-eight

This makes a much more effective end-stop than the overhand knot.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image152.webp" />

Make a loop. Carry the live end first behind, then around, the standing part. Bring it forward through the loop.

#### Figure-of-eight loop

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image153.webp" />

More secure than the overhand loop, this is made in the same way as the figure-of-eight, but with the line doubled, using the loop as the live end. It can be used over a spike anchor for a belaying rope.

#### Rewoven figure-of-eight

A useful anchoring knot where the top end of a projection is out of reach.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image154.webp" />

Make a loose figure-of-eight along the rope. Pass the live end around the anchor and feed it back around the figure-of-eight, following exactly. Ease tight.

### Joining ropes

#### Sheet bend

Used for joining ropes of the same or different thicknesses. It can be more effective than the reef knot with those of equal thickness. It is ideal for joining different materials, especially wet or frozen ropes.

Simple to tie, using up little of the rope length and swiftly unknotted if it has not been subjected to strain. It never slips if correctly made and strain is not erratic.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots04.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots05.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
2 Draw it tight and ease into shape as strain is increased.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Double sheet bend

A knot that is even more secure than the sheet bend. It is useful with wet ropes, especially if they are of very different thickness, but provides a good strong join in ropes of even thickness too. It is useful where strain is not constant and an ordinary sheet bend may slip.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots06.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">

2 Take the thin line end completely around the loop again and back through the same place on the outside of the thick loop. Draw it tight and ease into shape.

If not tightened these knots tend to work loose. Do NOT use with smooth materials such as nylon fishing line.

#### Tape knot

A useful knot for joining flat materials such as leather or webbing straps, tape and possibly even for joining sheets or other fabrics when improvising an escape rope. Experiment!

3 The live ends should be well clear of the knot so that they will not slip back when you tighten it.

#### Fisherman’s knot

A useful knot for joining together springy materials such as vines or wire. It is good for wet or slippery lines and particularly suitable for joining gut fishing line – soak the gut first to make it pliable. Very secure, it will hold well with thin lines but is very difficult to untie. Use when you do not trust the reef knot or sheet bend. It is NOT recommended for bulky ropes or nylon line.

Form a loop, pass the doubled live end through the loop, behind the standing part and back through the loop.  
  
This produces three loops which can be used for equipment haulage, or as a sit-sling or lifting- harness with one loop around each thigh and the other around the chest.

It takes some practice to get the proportions right – so learn to tie the triple bowline BEFORE you need to use it.

#### Bowline-on-the-bight

This is useful to support or for lifting anyone from a crevasse or elsewhere from which they cannot climb out. Make it with a doubled line, producing two loops which will neither tighten nor jam. It forms a kind of bosun’s chair, one loop fitting around the buttocks, the other around the upper body. As with the triple bowline, practise this knot BEFORE you need to know how to use it.

You may find many uses for fixed double loops. House and ship painters have been known to support their hanging platforms with a knot like this at each end. If the platform has a pole projecting at each corner, the loops of the bowline-on-the-bight can be slipped over. Notch the poles to prevent the ropes slipping off.

### Lasso

More loops

#### Manharness hitch

Also known as the Butterfly knot or Artillery knot, this makes a non-slip loop. It has the advantage that it can be made along the length of the rope, but does not require access to an end. Several loops could be put on a rope for harnessing people to pull together in haulage or raising a weight. Also a good way of preparing a rope for climbing. Toes and wrists can be put into the loops to carry the weight so that a rest can be taken when tired.

Different ways of making this knot may be found where the loop is not twisted at 3. The final strength of the loop does not appear to be affected either by making this twist or not, nor if the twist should straighten out in use.

#### Running bowline

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image164.webp" />

Use in any situation requiring a loop which will tighten easily. Make a small bowline and pass the long end of the rope through the loop.

Never tie a running bowline around the waist, particularly when climbing.

It acts like a hangman’s noose and could kill.

#### Honda knot

This is another knot that makes a free-running noose – but this one gives a clear circular loop suitable for throwing – it is a lasso.

You may find a use for this lasso in many ways but, in a survival situation, if you have only one length of rope, it would be unwise to spend much time and energy trying to catch animals in this way. It takes a lot of practice. When you really need the rope it may be worn and damaged from your lassoing efforts. However, it is worth making one to experiment with so that you have the skill already, should you need it for actual survival conditions.

Before trying to use a lasso on an animal consider its strength against your own. A large animal can – and almost certainly will – run. If you are not holding the rope firmly it may be dragged away and you will lose your meal and your rope. If the rope is anchored to you, YOU may be dragged along and severely injured. Can you make use of a firm anchor to carry the strain? A turn around a tree trunk or a rock may secure what is too powerful for you to restrain on your own.

### Hitches

These are knots for attaching ropes to posts, bars and poles.

#### Round turn and two half-hitches

This is the best way to secure a rope to a post. It can take strain from almost any direction.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots21.webp" />

Carry rope around behind the post, then around again. Bring live end over and back under the standing end and through the loop thus formed. Tighten and repeat the half-hitch to make the knot secure.

#### Timber hitch

This knot is used mainly as a start knot for lashings, but can also be used for hoisting and for dragging or towing heavy logs.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image171.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">

2 Carry it forward and tuck it beneath the rope encircling the bar. Twist it around as many times as comfortably fit. Tighten the knot by gently pulling on the standing end until a firm grip is achieved.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Clove hitch

An effective attachment when strain is perpendicular to the horizontal. It is not so good when strain comes at an angle or the direction of strain is erratic – this could loosen the clove hitch.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots22.webp" />

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
2 Close up and pull tight. It is possible to make a clove hitch in loops on a rope and to put the whole knot ready-made on to the spar - if you have access to the spar end. Many experienced knot-makers do this. Make a loose clove hitch and slip it off the spar. Lay it down and copy the loops formed by the rope. Slip onto the spar and tighten.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Killick hitch

Also known as the Anchor hitch – use it for securing a line to an anchoring weight. It can be used to secure an actual anchor for use in water or to hold back one end of a throwing line.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots24.webp" />

Make a timber hitch around one end of the rock or weight and tighten. Carry the line along the weight and make a half-hitch.

#### Marlin spike hitch

This is an instant, but temporary, knot for securing a mooring line to a post, or for dragging over the top of any upright peg or pole. It is particularly useful when tightening lashings. By temporarily attaching a short stout stick to the line it is possible to gain extra purchase on the line to administer a firmer pull.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots25.webp" />

Form a loop in the rope. Bring one side of the loop back up over the standing end. Drop this over the pole - the pole coming between the extended loop and the standing part. Pull the live end to tighten.

#### Ladders

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image173.webp" />

A ladder can be made by simply tying as many manharness hitches in a rope as you need for hand and foot holds. It could also be made with rungs, using strong sticks or pieces of wreckage.

Use two ropes or a long rope, doubled, with manharness hitches placed equally along both sides to make a rope ladder. Pass sticks through the corresponding loops, as you make the loops and ease tight to hold the sticks firmly. Allow the sticks to project a reasonable distance on either side of the ropes for safety and test each for strength.

#### Ladder of knots

A series of overhand knots tied at intervals along a smooth rope will make climbing it much easier.

There is a fast way of making these, once you have the knack.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image174.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
4 As each turn of rope comes through the centre of the half-hitch loops to the other end, shape and tighten each knot.
</figcaption>
</figure>

If you know the length of your rope you can estimate the number of knots you need. With a half-hitch for every knot, choose a thickness of log to allow the required number of turns – and therefore the required number of knots.

### Shortening rope

#### Sheepshank

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/knots26.webp" />

Treble the line. Form half-hitches in the outer lengths and slip them over the adjoining bends. Or, instead of half-hitches, when a loop is formed in the standing part, pull a bight through it and slip this over the bend in the rope. Tighten as you gradually increase tension.

Make a sheepshank more secure by passing a stick through the bend and behind the standing part. Or, if you have access to the rope’s end, pass that through the bight. A stick would make this more secure.

Never cut a rope unnecessarily – you never know when you may be glad of its full length. A knotted rope has only half the strength of a continuous one. Use the sheepshank to shorten it or to exclude a damaged or weakened section.

#### Quick-release knot

Variously known as the Highwayman’s hitch, Thief hitch and Thief knot. This knot is secure but will come untied with a single sharp tug on the live end. It is recommended for temporarily anchoring lines while working – or for situations which need a quick release.

### Securing loads

#### Prusik knot

A knot that makes a sliding loop, especially useful when attached along a climbing rope. It will not slip under tension, but will slide along the rope when tension is released. Also useful for ropes that need retensioning from time to time, such as tent guylines.

A pair of prusik knots along a rope provide hand and foot holds for climbing or for swinging along a horizontal line. They are slid along the main rope as you proceed.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
3 The prusik knot can be made using a fixed spliced loop - in which case pass the bight over the main rope and back through itself, and repeat.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: When used for climbing, or travelling along a rope, a spliced loop is safest. If you have no spliced loop, join the ends after the knot is made. Test joins rigorously before relying upon them.

#### Wakos transport knot

A knot invaluable for securing a high load to boat, raft, sledge, etc, or for tying down a roof. Maximum purchase is achieved by pulling down with all your weight and finally securing with two half-hitches. If it comes loose undo the hitches, retighten and secure. This knot can also be used for a line across a river or chasm which needs tightening from time to time.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image182.webp" />

1 Make a loop in the rope. Further down, towards the end of the rope, make a bight.

2 Pass the bight through the loop.

3 Make a twist in the new lower loop. Pass the end of the rope around securing point and up through this twist.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image183.webp" />

4 Pull on end to tighten.

5 With the end make two half-hitches around lower ropes to secure. Undo these to adjust and retighten.

### Lashings

Methods of lashing spars, logs, poles etc together differ according to the position of the components. Learn these techniques. They will be invaluable in making shelters, rafts and other structures.

#### Square lashing

This is for lashing spars which cross. Most effective when they do so at right-angles.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image184.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
3 Complete the circuits with a half-hitch around one spar and secure with a clove hitch on a spar at right-angles.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Diagonal lashing

An alternative to square lashing which is more effective when spars do not cross at right-angles, or more especially when the spars are under strain and have to be pulled towards one another for tying.

<figure>

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
4 Finish with a clove hitch on a convenient spar.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Round lashing

This is for lashing spars alongside each other or extending the length of a spar.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image191.webp" />

Begin with a clove hitch around both spars (a), then bind rope around them. Finish knot with a clove hitch at the other end (b). Force a wedge under the lashings to make them really tight. If the spars are vertical bang the wedge in downwards.

#### Shear lashing

For tying the ends of two spars at an angle, when making an A-frame, for example.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image192.webp" />

Begin with a clove hitch (a) around one spar. Bind around both spars – this binding should not be very tight. Bring rope between the spars and frap a couple of times around the binding. Finish with a clove hitch around the other spar (b). Tighten by opening up the shears (c).

A similar method can be used around three poles to make a tripod. Make turns around all three legs and frappings in the two gaps. The feet of A-frames and tripods should be anchored to stop them spreading.

### Net-making

Nets can be made either by making knots along pre-cut lengths of line or by ‘knitting’ mesh row by row. They are not only useful for fishing. A gill net can also be hung between trees to catch birds and a purse net, made from twine, can be placed over animal burrows. Use the same techniques to make a hammock from strong twine.

#### Gill net

Make this from parachute cords or from two thicknesses of twine. Parachute cord consists of an inner core of fine line within an outer core. Pull the fine inner line out and cut it into manageable and equal lengths (or cut lengths of thinner string). Their length will determine the depth of your net, which will be about 3/8 that of the length of line.

Decide how wide you want your net and set two poles that distance apart. Tie a length of parachute cord outer (or thicker twine) between the two. Cut a piece of wood about 3.5cm (1¼in) across. Use this as a gauge to space out the thinner vertical threads (inner core).

Fold each length double and use the bight to make a Prusik knot over the top cord and repeat across its length. Slide the Prusik knots along to space them out equally using your gauge.

For the first row, working from left to right; ignore the very first individual strand, but take the second of the pair. Hold it with the first strand of the next pair and tie both together in an overhand knot. Take the remaining strand with the first of the next pair and knot. Continue along the line, using your gauge to control spacing.

Proceed to the next row in the same way but this time include the outside lines to produce a row of diamonds. Continue until the line is used up.

To finish off the bottom, stretch another thicker line across between the supports and tie off all the inners (or thinner strings) in pairs around it. Carry each pair around it twice. Separate the pair and tie off around the pair.

Complete the net by securing the top and bottom lines at each corner of the net so that the net will not slip off the ends. Any surplus can be used for attaching the net to supports and weights to keep it in position when in use.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Prusik knot (left) and overhand knot (right)
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### ‘Knitting’ a net

A method suitable for nylon fishing line or any other fine line. You need a horizontal string between posts, a mesh gauge, and a ‘needle’.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image197.webp" />

Make the ‘needle’ (a) about 15cm long x 2.5cm wide (6 x 1in) from hardwood or bamboo. Make a notch at either end and wind line around the whole needle; or try something more traditional like the lower drawing. The needle must be smooth. The line is gradually unwound as you make the net.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image198.webp" />

To make the net, tie a top line of required length between uprights. Begin by tying a clove hitch with thinner line (b). Take the needle behind the top line and bring it forward to make another clove hitch (c). Repeat along the line, spacing the knots out with your gauge (d).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image199.webp" />

When the top row is complete go to the other side of the posts (easier than working backwards) and make the next row. Make each new loop large enough to form a square of the mesh (half-square at each outside edge). Take the needle through the loop of the row above from behind, round the back of the loop and then through the front of the loop it makes (e). Adjust the depth with your gauge before you tighten (f).

Switch sides again and work back in the opposite direction for the next row and continue until the net is the required length.

Tie off the bottom line with another thicker twine using the same knot but keeping the line straight without loops. Leave some free line at both ends. Tie in the ends at the top corners and the net is complete.

#### Net hammock

Make a net about 75cm (2.5ft) across and wider than your height. Use good strong twine or rope for the top and bottom lines – double twine would be a good idea, the ends have to carry your weight. Leave those ends long enough to suspend the hammock by.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image200.webp" />

Cut two spacer bars to keep the hammock ‘open’. Notch the ends and slip the cords into the notches (a). To simplify hanging the hammock you could tie each pair of end lines to a fixed loop such as a bowline. Then fix one end with a round turn and two half-hitches, the other with a quick-release knot, in case you ever need to leave the hammock in a hurry.

### Fishing knots

#### Hook on to gut

Turle knot.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image201.webp" />

Soak the gut. Thread it through eye of hook. Make an overhand loop and pass a bight through it (a) to form a simple slip knot (b). Pass hook through slip knot (c) and pull tight around shank.

#### Hook on to nylon # 1

Half-blood knot.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image202.webp" />

Thread end through eye. Make four turns around standing part. Pass live end through the loop formed next to the hook (d).

– Pull taut and snip off fairly close to end (e).

#### Hook on to nylon #2

Two-turn turf knot.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image203.webp" />

Thread the hook. Pass the live end around the standing part to form a loop and through it. Twist live end twice around side of loop. Hold the loop and pull the twists tight. Pass the hook through the loop (f).

– Pull on standing part to tighten loop on hook (g).

#### Jam knots

For securing improvised hooks to gut or cord.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image204.webp" />

With an eye: Thread gut. Make two turns around hook and bring live end up through turns (h). Ease tight and test for strength.

– Without an eye: Make loop around lower part of shaft. Make two half-hitches from upper end downwards and pass live end through lower loop (i). Pull on standing part to tighten.

#### Loop in nylon #1

Double overhand loop.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image205.webp" />

Double the line to make a bight. Tie an overhand in it (a). Twist the end through again (b). Pull tight (c) and snip off end.

#### Loop in nylon #2

Blood bight.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image206.webp" />

Form a bight. Twist the end of it back around the standing part (d). Bring end back through new loop (e). Pull tight and snip off loose end.

#### Joining loops

Can be used in nylon line but will work for different strong materials. A Fisherman’s knot is recommended for gut, which probably could not stand the strain of this method.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image207.webp" />

- With free ends: Pass each line through the other loop (f) and pull tight (g).

- With only one end free: Make loop on one line.

Take the live end of the other line through the loop, around it and back through and then tie off with either of the knots for hooks on to nylon.

:::info[how to be eco-friendly]

Whatever your situation, and wherever your camp, survival must always take priority and in actual fact a group of survivors will have very little impact on their immediate environment. Having said that you should try not to decimate the area you find yourself in and always try and leave a place better than you found it. There are a number of ways in which you can ensure this happens: only take standing dead wood for a fire, only catch sick, lame, or lazy animals, and if you’re cutting saplings you’re encouraging growth in any case.

## **On the move**

> **Having chosen a course and planned a route, you must be able to maintain direction, to match your progress to the type of terrain and the nature of the survival group, and to exploit any techniques that make progress easier. This section deals with skills needed on the move. It should be read in conjunction with the techniques described in Extreme Climates.**
>
> **Careful reconnaisance may be necessary to choose the easiest routes – which may not be the obvious or the quickest ones. Groups must be organized to suit the least able, or provision made for carrying them.**
>
> **Waterways can offer the easiest routes to move along, if they are easily navigable and you are able to construct a raft. They can also present formidable barriers if they lie across the route you have to follow. Rivers can be dangerous. You must learn to assess the hazards they present and select the best places and methods of crossing, if crossing is unavoidable.**

Whether setting off on a hunting expedition or beginning the trek back to civilization, you will need skills in negotiating terrain and in navigation – either to ensure your return to camp or to keep to your chosen route. Even if you do not have a map, your own reconnaissance will have established your immediate terrain. Guessing what is beyond is much more problematic if you have to assess it for yourself.

On short expeditions take note of the terrain as you move outwards to ensure that you can find your way back to camp. Over short distances physical features will be your guide and you can also mark your trail, but when going further or striking back to civilization you will need all the navigational aids available.

#### The decision to move

Except when local dangers or the need to find water and food make it imperative that you move away from the site of your accident to make camp, you will stay close in the hope of rescue. If you have injured persons and only limited food and water, it would make sense to send a party to contact help while others stay to care for the sick. The fittest and most able should be chosen to make the trek – unless they include a trained medic, who should stay with the sick.

But what if no rescue comes? Local resources may become exhausted: you go further each day to collect firewood, the game in the area has gone, plants, fungi, fruits and nuts are more difficult to find or require long forays out of camp. Under survival conditions there is also an increased risk of disease from staying too long in one place. Even with the strictest sanitary management the chance of disease gradually builds up.

All these will be pressing you to move. Whether that be a move to new territory or the beginning of a trek back to civilization, many of the same problems will occur and – since there are few situations so idyllic that survivors will prefer their new life to their old – it would be sensible to plan any move as the first stage of the journey out. The exceptions will be where there are still sick people on their way to recovery, or better resources are needed to provision a push through alien territory. A move to a more comfortable camp in a more hospitable area will provide better chances of recovery for the injured or sick and the chance to build up the necessary surplus and equipment ready for the final trek.

If you have a map or a clear idea of your location make for the nearest known settlement. If you have no idea where you are then the best course is usually to follow waterways DOWNSTREAM, for they will clearly define a route and generally lead to populated areas.

Even if you are simply changing the location of your camp there is no point in just moving a mile away – as you will soon have the same problems that made you decide to leave your first camp. The territory will not be entirely fresh. Move two or three days’ journey at least so that fuel, flora and fauna will all be undisturbed.

Although you may expect similar resources to be available, as long as you are travelling through similar terrain, remember that you have been hunting and foraging with experience of where things are best found or trapped and with known supplies of fuel and water. You will have to find your basic needs in new territory and when you move into different terrain availability may change dramatically – for better or worse.

#### Preparations

Before you finally abandon camp leave signs that will make it clear you have been there and have moved on (see [Signalling](/sas-survival-guide/ssg-essentials#signalling)). Leave a message giving a list of who is in the party and details of your intentions. Mark the trail as you proceed so that if searchers do find the camp they will be able to follow you.

Build up a stock of preserved food, make water bottles and larger containers too if you envisage crossing waterless territory, and litters or other means of transporting any remaining sick, the old or very young. Make suitable foot-coverings and clothing for everyone and packs to carry equipment and supplies. Some form of transport may be possible – a sledge or raft.

Take shelter material with you – cloth, canvas, ponchos, even sticks if they are likely to be scarce in the terrain you are crossing. A shelter which can be quickly re-erected, will conserve energy for more urgent gathering than roofing materials and supports. Naturally, you will take signalling gear, for you may find an opportunity to make that vital contact which will bring rescue.

Study weather patterns carefully to choose a time for travel when the weather is likely to be settled.

#### Hudson bay pack

A comfortable and easily improvised way of carrying equipment, this needs strong and preferably waterproof material about 90cm (3ft) square, two small stones and cord or thonging more than long enough to loop across the body.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image209.webp" />

Place stones in diagonally opposite corners of the cloth. Fold ends of cloth over stones. Tie cord below the stones, securing them in position. The stones in turn prevent the cord slipping off. Lay cloth on the ground and roll possessions up tightly. Wrap pack around the body, either across the back or around the waist.

#### Carrying people

Pickaback and fireman’s lifts are impracticable for long distances and stretchers are difficult to handle. Sit small children on a backpack frame or make carrying chairs on poles to be borne by several people. If you are alone, try a sledge or travois (see [Furnishing the Camp](#furnishing-the-camp)). Equipment can be carried in the same way.

#### Backpack frame

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image210.webp" />

Make a ladder frame to fit against your back, with a right angle projection at the bottom secured by side struts. Add shoulder straps and a belt loop. Use this to support a bag, a bundle of supplies or equipment tied into place.

#### Fork frame

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image211.webp" />

A quicker, but less-efficient support can be made from a forked bough with cross-pieces to which baggage can be tied.

#### Baby bag

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image212.webp" />

Carry babies and small children papoose-style on your back or front. Tie lower corners of a rectangle of cloth around the waist, pop the child in and tie the upper corners around your neck. Pad at neck to ease pressure or chafing.

#### Making a sledge

Sledges are particularly useful on snow and ice, when they will move most smoothly, but may also be used on smooth ground. The shape of the front runners is critical, especially on snow. You can make use of doors and cowlings from a crashed aircraft or vehicle in the construction. Tie lines to the front runners with a bowline to the people hauling – ideally two at the front, and two at the rear as brakemen on gradients. Test thoroughly before using on a long trek.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image213.webp" />

Choose two forked branches and remove one side of each fork. Make smooth for the runners and lash on cross-members. Alternatively, choose two longer supple runners. Bend and brace as shown. This arrangement keeps the lashings off the ground and may be more comfortable for an injured person. Whichever method you use, add at least one diagonal for strength.

### Planning

If you are on very high ground, above a large plain, it may be possible to plot out a route with some precision. In most situations visibility will be restricted and you will have to guess what is over the furthest ridge and what occupies the ‘dead’ ground ahead. Even when you can see the terrain ahead, it is difficult to see the details. What looks like a manageable slope may prove a barrier when you get closer to it. If you have them, make good use of field glasses in studying every potential route.

To see further you may consider climbing a tree – but keep close to the trunk and test each branch before risking your weight on it. This is NO time to risk a fall.

#### Following rivers

Following a watercourse, however small, offers a route to civilization and a life-support system on the way. Most rivers lead eventually to the sea or great inland lakes. Apart from the rare exception where rivers suddenly descend beneath the earth, they offer clearly defined routes to follow. Sometimes, in their upper reaches, they may cut through gorges and it can be impossible or inadvisable to take a route along their banks, which may be steep, rocky and slippery. In that case take to high ground and cut off the bends, following the general course of the stream.

On more level ground a river is easier to follow and may well have animal trails beside it which you can use. In tropical conditions the vegetation is likely to be denser by the river – for the light can reach below the trees, and the banks may be hard to negotiate. If the river is wide enough it would be worth considering building a raft. Even if there is no bamboo, which makes an ideal raft-building material, there are likely to be sound fallen trees for timber.

When, on flat plains, a river makes huge meanders, the inside of the loops may be swampy and prone to flooding – you can recognize such very wet ground by the lushness of the vegetation and rush-like plants. Avoid marshy areas if you can, and cut across the loop.

#### Maintaining direction

Having decided upon a direction, try to maintain it. Choose a prominent feature in the distance and keep heading towards it. Travelling through forests makes orientation very difficult and a compass becomes a valuable asset.

If you are in featureless territory, but in a group of three or more, separate to follow each other at wider intervals and look back frequently. If you are following in each other’s tracks those behind you will be directly behind each other. If the party always moves on in relay – one moving on ahead, then resting while everyone else moves up from the rear – the straight line will be maintained. On your own you can try to align yourself by looking backwards at your own tracks if they are visible, as they are likely to be on snow or sand. Better still, you can set up sticks or piles of stones in alignment with each other so that you can check that you are not deviating from your route.

If possible skirt rocky outcrops and areas of dense vegetation and, once on high ground, stick to it until certain that you have found the spur down which you can make the best progress in the desired direction.

### Moving in groups

Always move in an organized manner, in some kind of formation, and not as an unruly gaggle. This way it will be easier to check that no stragglers have been left behind and to ensure that there is help for anyone in difficulty. Before setting out for the day, have a briefing to discuss the route, any obstacles expected and any special procedures.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/02_camp/image215.webp" />

Always move in an organized manner, dividing responsibilities between individuals and preparing for any foreseeable obstacles. Before setting out each morning, conduct a daily briefing to familiarize yourself with the route, the plan and any special procedures that need to be followed.

#### Divide responsibilities

One person becomes a scout, responsible for selecting the best route, avoiding dead falls, loose rocks etc and finding the best way down a slope.

Number two is responsible for making sure the scout, who will be preoccupied with skirting obstacles, maintains correct overall direction.

Others should relieve them frequently, for the lead scout’s job in particular is very tiring.

The rest of the party should keep their eyes open for edible plants, berries and fruits and everyone should be responsible for at least one other person to ensure that no one drops by the wayside. A head count and check on everyone’s condition is particularly important after a river crossing or negotiating a particularly tricky stretch of terrain. Someone should initiate equipment checks at frequent intervals.

Always travel in at least pairs – and be especially careful in bad weather, and if you have to travel at night, that you do not get split up. It is usually the person in front who gets split off from the group – people are more likely to remember to look for the stragglers. The scout climbs over an obstacle, the second person sees the scout struggling and then sees an easier route to take – the rest of the party follow and the lead person is separated from the group. This is when the benefit of EVERYONE knowing the proposed route, and nominating prominent features as rallying points, is apparent.

If separated or in an emergency everyone knows where to regroup.

Availability of water, fuel and plants may be an indication of what is available in similar locations further ahead. An eye should always be open for places that offer good shelter – if the weather suddenly turns bad you can backtrack to one of them.

### Pace and progress

- A large group can send an advance party ahead with the responsibility for clearing the route and setting up the night’s camp, ready for the slower-moving injured or less able. A clear trail will make the carrying of baggage and any unfit people much easier. Sick and injured should be provided with fully-fit escorts in case they encounter any difficulties.

- Ensure that the lead person in the party does not go too fast for those behind. After an obstacle wait and allow everyone to catch up before moving on.

- It is best to try to maintain an even pace – smooth, pendulum-like movement tires the legs less than a jerky pace or flexing the knees. It helps to swing the arms – and they should certainly not be pushed in the pockets, especially when going up or down hills for if you then slip you have less chance of stopping yourself falling or sliding.

- Rest frequently (whether in a party or alone). Stop, sit down and see how everyone is doing. Adjust loads which are uncomfortable and repack them if necessary. On average take a break of 10 minutes every 30–45 minutes, depending on the terrain and condition of the group.

- On steep ground the pace should be shortened, on easy ground lengthened. On descents avoid overstepping for this jars the body and increases fatigue.

- On steep or slippery ground ropes can provide a hand hold to help people negotiate a particularly tricky stretch (quite apart from abseiling and other climbing techniques). They will be an asset on scree, as much as on icy slopes.

- You can also use a line with Prusik knots attached so that the young and the aged can be tied to a fixed rope for extra safety (see [Knots](#knots)).

- In estimating the distance you have covered allow 3km (under 2 miles) per hour, but going uphill knock off a third.

### Walking at night

Negotiating unknown territory at night can be very dangerous, but may be necessary in an emergency, or there are circumstances – in the desert for instance – when it may be more comfortable to travel at night.

The night is never completely dark and outdoor vision is not totally lost, even for man. However, because it is difficult to see things clearly you are easily disoriented, which leads to a feeling of being lost. A compass is a great help in maintaining a heading and dispelling any such fears. It is always darker among trees than out in the open – so keep to open country if you can.

When looking at an object at night it is best to look at one side of it and not directly at it. It is difficult to distinguish anything in a dark central mass but the edges show more clearly and in poor light objects at the edges of your vision are often seen more distinctly.

Once the eyes get accustomed to the dark, more and more is seen as ‘night vision’ is acquired. It takes about 30–40 minutes for the eyes to get accustomed to the dark. Once this is achieved, the eyes must be protected from bright light or the night vision will be impaired for quite a while. If there is an unavoidable reason for having to use a light, cover one eye so that the vision in that eye at least will be retained. If, for instance, you need to consult a map, a red filter over a torch will help you to retain your night vision.

The ears are good sensors in the dark – the sound of a river, for instance, provides a good guide to how fast it is flowing. Vegetation can be smelt in the dark and familiar smells can aid identification.

Walk SLOWLY in the dark and test each step before putting all your weight forward. If going down a slope use a shuffling step.

:::note[Case study: SURVIVING SOLO]

Never head off on any adventure without months of preparation and training. Experience and knowledge save lives.

A British student fell from a mountain trail and was swept over a waterfall while trekking alone in Bolivia. Luke Dance, a 19-year-old from Loughborough University, was narrowly saved from drowning in a whirlpool after falling into a river in the country’s sub-tropical Yungas region in September 2000. He finally found his way out of the jungle after living in a makeshift encampment for two weeks before wading through rapids and jungle in a two-day hike to the nearest village.

Emerging two stone lighter, he was a bit battered and bruised from the jungle where he had survived on meagre food rations that eventually ran out. He had set out 25 days earlier on a four-day solo trek.

The weight of Luke’s backpack took him over the side and he fell into the river - about a 3.6m (12ft) drop. He could not climb out because it was too steep and ended up falling over a 4.5m (15ft) waterfall. Luke was drawn into a whirlpool where he was trapped for a while but his backpack saved him because it was full of air.

Confronted by another 9.1m (30ft) waterfall, Luke set up camp and hoped to attract the attention of any passers-by then eked out his rations for two weeks. When his food ran out, he decided he had no option but to trek through the jungle. He went through several waterfalls and rapids for two days before he could get out of the water and make his way to the nearest village.

A keen climber, parachutist and sportsman, Luke had taken part in several Army-organized training courses and was due to join the Royal Engineers after his degree.

**LESSONS LEARNT**

- Be prepared. Luke was physically strong and had climbing and survival experience. He knew to stay put and conserve energy in the hope of rescue, but to move on when his rations were exhausted.
- Never attempt a solo trek without previous training.
