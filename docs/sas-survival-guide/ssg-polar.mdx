## **Climate zones**

> **People often view an alien environment as an enemy and feel they must fight it. This is not the way to survive – fight it and you will lose! There are dangers against which precautions must be taken, but nature is neutral. Learn to live with each climate and to use what it offers. Climate is not conditioned only by latitude; location within a continent and altitude are equally important.**

#### Polar climates

Polar regions are regarded as those at latitudes higher than 60°33' north and south, but cold-weather skills may be needed at very high altitudes everywhere. Near the Equator, in the Andes for example, the snow line is not reached until an altitude of about 5000m (16,500ft), but the nearer the poles the lower the snow line will be – at the southern tip of South America there is permanent snow at only a few hundred metres (a thousand feet). Arctic conditions penetrate deep into the northern territories of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia and Russia.

#### Tundra

South of the polar cap, the ground remains permanently frozen and vegetation is stunted. Snow melts in summer, but roots cannot penetrate the hard earth. High altitudes produce similar conditions.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image002.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
The Arctic tundra is vast, and a very stark landscape.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Northern coniferous forest

Between the arctic tundra and the main temperate lands is a forest zone, up to 1300km (800 miles) deep. In Russia, where it is known as the Taiga, the forests penetrate up to 1650km (1025 miles) north of the Arctic Circle along some Siberian rivers, but in the Hudson Bay area of Canada the tree line moves an equal distance south of the Circle.

Winters are long and severe, the ground frozen for much of the time, summers are short. For only 3–5 months of the year is the ground thawed sufficiently for water to reach the roots of the trees and plants, which especially flourish along the great rivers that flow to the Arctic Ocean. There is a wealth of game: elk, bear, otter, lynx, sable and squirrel, as well as smaller creatures, and many birds.

In summer, where the snow melt cannot drain, it creates swamps. Fallen trees and dense growths of sphagnum moss make the going difficult. Mosquitoes can be a nuisance (but they do not carry malaria).

Movement is easier in winter, if you have warm clothing. Travel along the rivers, where fishing is good, making a raft from the abundant deadfalls.

#### Temperate climates

The temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, and the similar climates of the southern hemisphere, probably offer the most equitable circumstances for survival without special skills or knowledge. They will be the areas best known to many readers of this book. These territories are also those most heavily urbanized and where the survival ordeal is not likely to be very extended.

A fit and healthy person, equipped with basic skills, would not be so cut off that they could not reach help within a few days’ trek. Heavy winter conditions may call for polar skills.

#### Deciduous forest

As the climate gets warmer and winters less severe, deciduous forest replaces the conifers. Oak, beech, maple and hickory are the main species in America; oak, beech, chestnut and lime, in Eurasia. Soil rich in humus supports many plants and fungi. Survival is not difficult, except at very high altitudes where tundra, or snowfield conditions, appear. Many of these areas have been cleared by man.

#### Temperate grassland

Mainly central continental areas with hot summers, cold winters and moderate rainfall, these have become the world’s great food-producing areas – grain is grown and cattle reared. Water can be a problem in summer and shelter in winter.

#### Mediterranean regions

The lands bordering on the Mediterranean are semi-arid areas, with long hot summers and short dry winters. There is sunshine most of the year, and drying winds. At one time this region was forested with oaks. When these were cut down the soil eroded, much of the area became covered with evergreen shrub. The chaparral of California is very similar. Trees are few and water is a problem. At high altitudes, other conditions prevail.

#### Tropical forests

The land between the tropics includes areas of cultivation and extremes of swamp and desert, but one-third is undeveloped forest: equatorial rainforest, sub-tropical rainforest and montane forest. All feature high rainfall and rugged mountains, which drain into large, swift-flowing rivers, with coastal and other low-lying regions often as swampland.

#### Savannah

This is tropical grassland, lying usually between the desert and the tropical forest. Near the forests the grass is tall, up to 3m (10ft) high, and trees more frequent. Temperatures are high the whole year round. More than one-third of Africa is savannah, as are large areas of Australia, which are dotted with eucalyptus trees. Similar areas are the llanos of Venezuela and Colombia and the campos in Brazil. Often water is not easily available but, where it is found, there will be lusher vegetation and plenty of wildlife. In Africa large herds of animals can be found.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Africa contains the largest amount of savannah.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Deserts

One-fifth of the earth’s land surface is desert – dry barren land where survival is very difficult. Deserts occur where air currents, which rose at the Equator and have already shed their moisture, descend and are rewarmed as they near the Earth, taking what little local moisture is present. There are rarely any clouds to give protection from the sun or to retain heat at night so that great extremes of temperature occur from the highest shade temperatures (58°C/136°F in the Sahara) to below freezing point at night. Only small parts of the world’s deserts are sand (about one-tenth of the Sahara); the greater part is flat gravel cut by dried-up watercourses (wadis). The wind has blown the sand away, piling it up in low-lying areas. Elsewhere there may be wind-carved mountains, dried mudflats and lava flows.

## **Polar regions**

> **Antarctica is covered with a sheet of ice. In the Arctic, the Pole is capped by deep ice floating on the sea and all the land north of the timber line is frozen. There are only two seasons – a long winter and a short summer – the day varying from complete darkness in midwinter to 24 hours daylight at midsummer.**

Arctic summer temperatures can rise to 18°C (65°F), except on glaciers and frozen seas, but fall in winter to as low as –56°C (–69°F) and are never above freezing point. In the northern forests summer temperatures can reach 37°C (100°F), but altitude pushes winter temperatures even lower than in the Arctic. In eastern Siberia –69°C (–94°F) has been recorded at Verkhotansk! Temperatures in the Antarctic are even lower than in the Arctic.

Antarctic winds of 177kph (110mph) have been recorded and, in the Arctic autumn, winter winds reach hurricane force and can whip snow 30m (100ft) into the air, giving the impression of a blizzard – even when it is not snowing. Accompanied by low temperatures, winds have a marked chilling effect – much greater than the thermometer indicates. For instance, a 32kph (20mph) wind will bring a temperature of –14°C (7°F) down to –34°C (–30°F) and one at 64kph (40mph) would make it –42°C (–44°F) with even greater drops at lower temperatures. Speeds over 64kph (40mph) do not appear to make a greater difference.

### Travel

Experience shows the best policy is to stay near an aircraft or disabled vehicle. If the spot is hazardous establish a safe shelter as close by as possible. A decision to walk out will be based on nearness to civilization and probability of rescue.

Decide early what to do – while you can still think clearly. Cold dulls the mind.

Movement in a blizzard is out of the question and, at all times, navigation is difficult on featureless ice and tundra. Ice movement pushes up ridges which make the going treacherous. Summer melt water makes the tundra boggy and even sea ice slushy underfoot.

Mosquito, black-fly, deerfly and midges can all be a nuisance in the Arctic summer. Their larvae live in water – avoid making shelter nearby. Keep sleeves down, collar up, wear a net over the head and burn green wood and leaves on the fire – smoke keeps them at bay. When it turns colder, these nuisances are less active and they disappear at night.

In Alaska, north-western and north-eastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Novaya Zemlya, Spitzbergen and on other islands there are mountains where ice cliffs, glaciers, crevasses and avalanches are hazards. Near the Arctic coastline frequent fog from May to August, sometimes carried far inland.

#### Navigation

Compasses are unreliable near the Poles, the constellations are better direction-finders and the nights are light enough to travel by. By day use the shadow tip method (see [Reading the Signs](/sas-survival-guide/ssg-essentials#reading-the-signs)).

Travelling on sea ice do NOT use icebergs or distant landmarks to fix direction. Floes are constantly moving – relative positions may change. Watch for ice breaking up and, if forced to cross from floe to floe, leap from and to a spot at least 60cm (2ft) from the edge. Survivors have been rescued from floes drifting south but sooner or later ice floating into the warmer oceans will melt – though that chance may be worth taking.

AVOID icebergs, they have most of their mass below the water. As this melts, they can turn over without warning, particularly with your added weight.

AVOID sailing close to ice cliffs. Glaciers may ‘calve’ huge masses of ice, often thousands of tons, which break off into the sea without warning.

Bird observations can aid navigation. Migrating wildfowl fly to land in the thaw. Most seabirds fly out to sea during the day and return at night.

Sky reflections help to determine distant terrain. Clouds over open water, timber or snow-free ground appear black below; over sea ice and snowfields, white. New ice produces greyish reflections, mottled ones indicate pack ice or drifted snow.

#### Snow shoes

All polar travel is strenuous and should only be attempted by a fit person. On snow with a hard crust, skis are the best means of travel, though difficult to improvise. Skiing in deep loose snow takes great effort and, in soft snow, snow shoes are better. To walk in snow shoes lift each foot without angling it, unlike a normal stride, keeping the shoe as flat to the ground as possible.

#### Follow rivers

Travel downstream – by raft in summer, on the ice in winter – except in northern Siberia where rivers flow north.

On frozen rivers keep to smoother ice at the edges and to outer curve on the bends. Where two rivers join follow the outside edge or take to the outer bank. If the river has many bends, leave the ice and travel by higher ridges.

ICE COLD WATER IS A KILLER

Falling into icy water knocks the breath out of you. The body curls up with loss of muscular control and violent shivering. Exposed parts freeze in about 4 minutes, consciousness clouds in 7, death follows in 15–20.

RESIST! Take violent action on hitting the water. Move fast for land. Then roll in snow to absorb water. Get to shelter and into dry kit immediately.

:::

#### Clothing

Severe cold and harsh winds can freeze unprotected flesh in minutes. Protect the whole body, hands and feet. Wear a hood – it should have a drawstring so that it can partly cover the face. Fur trimming will prevent moisture in the breath freezing on the face and injuring the skin.

Outer garments should be windproof, with a close enough weave to prevent snow compacting, but porous enough to allow water vapour to escape – NOT waterproof, which could create condensation inside. Underlayers should trap air to provide heat insulation. Skins make ideal outer clothing.

Openings allow heat to escape, movement can drive air out through them. If clothing has no draw strings, tie something around sleeves above cuffs, tuck trousers into socks or boots.

If you begin to sweat loosen some closures (collar, cuffs). If still too warm remove a layer. Do so when doing jobs like chopping wood or shelter-building.

Only a plane crash or forced landing is likely to leave someone in polar regions unequipped. Try to improvise suitable clothing before leaving the plane.

Wear wool – it does not absorb water and is warm even when damp. Spaces between the knit trap body heat. It is best for inner garments.

Cotton acts like a wick, absorbing moisture. When wet, it can lose heat 240 times faster than when dry.

:::tip[C.O.L.D. – The key to keeping warm]

Keep it CLEAN – Dirt and grease block air spaces!

Avoid OVERHEATING – Ventilate!

Wear it LOOSE – Allow air to circulate!

Keep it DRY – Outside and inside!

:::

#### Feet

Mukluks, boots of waterproof canvas with a rubber sole which comes up to the caulk and with a drawstring to adjust fitting, are ideal. Ideally they should have an insulated liner.

Insulate feet with three pairs of socks, graded in size to fit over each other and not wrinkle. If necessary, improvise foot coverings with several layers of fabric. Canvas seat covers can make improvised boots.

Trenchfoot can develop when the feet are immersed in water for long periods, as in the boggy tundra during the summer months (see [Cold Climate Hazards](/sas-survival-guide/first-aid#placeholder-cold-climate-harzards)).

#### Snow glare

Protect the eyes with goggles or a strip of cloth or bark with narrow slits cut for eyes. The intensity of the sun’s rays, reflected by snow, can cause snow blindness. Blacken beneath the eyes with charcoal to reduce glare further.

</figcaption>
</figure>

### Shelter

You cannot stay in the open to rest. GET OUT OF THE WIND! Look for natural shelter you can improve on, but AVOID the lee side of cliffs where snow could drift and bury your shelter, or sites where rock fall or avalanche is likely. Avoid snowladen trees – the weight could bring down frozen branches – unless the lower boughs are supported on the snow. There may be a space beneath the branch which will provide a ready-made shelter.

remember Don’t block EVERY hole to keep out draughts. You MUST have ventilation, especially if burning a fire inside your shelter. Otherwise you may asphyxiate.

### Fire

Essential for polar survival. Fuel oil from wreckage can provide heat. Drain oil from sump and reservoir on to the ground as soon as possible – as it cools it will congeal and become impossible to drain. High octane fuel does not freeze so quickly – leave it in the tanks.

In the Antarctic and on the Arctic ice, seal and bird fat are the only other fuel sources. On coasts driftwood can sometimes be collected – Greenlanders used to build homes from timber which drifted across the Arctic from Siberian rivers.

In the tundra low, spreading, willow can be found. Birch scrub and juniper also grow beyond the forests. Birch bark makes excellent kindling – the wood is oily. Feather a branch and it will burn even when wet.

Casiope is another low spreading heather-like plant that Eskimos use for fuel. Evergreen, with tiny leaves and white bell-shaped flowers, and only 10-30cm (4-12in) high, it contains so much resin that it, too, burns when wet.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image011.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">

</figcaption>
</figure>

### Water

Even in the cold you need over a litre (1¾pt) daily to replace losses. In summer water is plentiful in tundra lakes and streams. Pond water may look brown and taste brackish but vegetation growing in it keeps it fresh. If in doubt BOIL.

In winter melt ice and snow. Do NOT eat crushed ice, it can injure your mouth and lips and also cause further dehydration. Thaw snow sufficiently to mould into a ball before attempting to suck it.

remember If already cold and tired, eating snow will further chill your body.

### Food

Antarctic: Lichens and mosses, growing on dark, heat-absorbing rocks on some northern coasts, are the only plants. Seas are rich in plankton and krill which support fish, whales, seals and many seabirds. Most birds migrate in autumn, but flightless penguins stay. They make good eating. Most of the year they take to the water at the first sign of danger but, when incubating eggs, sit tight on their burrows or scrapes.

Arctic: Ice provides no habitat for plants or ground animals, even polar bears are likely only where they can find prey – and they are difficult and dangerous to hunt. Seabirds, fish and seals, where there is water, are the potential foods. Foxes – the Arctic fox turns white in winter – sometimes follow polar bears on to sea ice to scavenge their kills. Northern wildlife is migratory and availability depends on season.

Tundra and forest: Plants and animals can be found in winter and summer and the northern forests offer even more wildlife. Tundra plant species are the same in Russia as in Alaska. All are small compared to warmer-climate plants: ground spreading willow, birch and berry plants with high vitamin content. Lichens and mosses, found widely, form a valuable food source – especially reindeer moss.

#### Poisonous plants

The majority of Arctic plants are edible, but AVOID water hemlock – the most poisonous. AVOID the fruit of the baneberry. AVOID small Arctic buttercups. Other temperate poisonous species found far north include lupin, monkshood, larkspur, vetch (locoweed), false hellebore and death camas. Best avoid fungi too – make sure you can distinguish lichens from them! There are no Arctic plants which are known to produce contact poisoning.

:::info[polar bears]

Confined to the high Arctic – in Europe only resident on Spitzbergen – they have a keen sense of smell and are tireless hunters on sea ice and in the sea. Feeding mainly on seals, with some fish, they swim well and can stay submerged for two minutes. Rarely found on land – though in summer they may feed on berries and lemmings. Like many cold-climate animals they are larger than their warmer-climate relatives. Most are curious and will come to you – but treat these powerful animals with respect and caution.

Always cook meat: muscles always carry the Trichinosis worm. NEVER eat polar bear liver which can have lethal concentrations of vitamin A.

:::

#### Animals for food

Bark and greenery stripped from trees is evidence of feeding animals. Caribou (reindeer) are common from Alaska to west Greenland and found across northern Scandinavia and Siberia. Shaggy musk-ox roam in northern Greenland and, in the islands of the Canadian archipelago, elk (moose) are found – where there is a mixture of forest and open ground.

Wolves are common in northern Canada, Alaska and Siberia (but rare and protected in most European countries). Foxes, living in the tundra in summer and open woodland in winter, are an indication of other, smaller prey – mountain hares, squirrels and other small rodents which burrow beneath the snow to find seeds. Lemmings make runways beneath the snow. Beaver, mink, wolverines and weasels can all be found in the Arctic.

Bears roam the barren lands of the north as well as the forests. They can be dangerous. Give them a wide berth.

The best chances for survival are along coasts where the sea provides a dependable source of food. Seals are found on coasts and pack ice and in the open water.

Walruses may look cumbersome but are also very dangerous. LEAVE THEM ALONE UNLESS YOU ARE ARMED.

#### Hunting and trapping

Tracks are clear in snow and easy to follow – but leave a trail of fluttering flags of bright material from wreckage to find your way back to your shelter. Make them high enough not to be covered by a fresh snowfall.

Caribou can be very curious and may sometimes be lured by waving a cloth and moving on all fours. Imitating a four-legged animal may also bring wolves closer, thinking you might be prey. Ground squirrels and marmots may run into you if you are between them and their holes. Some prey animals can be attracted by the sound made by kissing the back of your hand. It is like the noise made by a wounded mouse or bird. Make it from a concealed position and downwind. Be patient. Keep on trying.

Stalking animals is difficult in the exposed Arctic. If you have a projectile weapon – gun, bow, catapult – which can be fired from ground level, lie in ambush behind a screen of snow. To be more mobile make a screen of cloth which can stand in front of you, and slowly be moved forward.

In winter, owls, ravens and ptarmigans – the birds available in the north – are usually ‘tame’ and can be approached slowly, without sudden movements. Many polar birds have a 2–3 week summer moult, which makes them flightless – they can be run down. Eggs are among the safest foods and are edible at any stage of embryo development.

#### Seals

A main source of food on polar ice, some seals remain there right through the winter. The Antarctic Weddel seal, most southerly of mammals, can dive for 15 minutes before coming up to breathe from pockets of air beneath the ice, or at small holes which it keeps open by nibbling around the edges. Most seals must breathe more frequently. Few are as formidable as the Elephant seal, which can rear up to twice a man’s height in attack or defence.

Seals are most vulnerable on the ice floes with their young pups (produced between March and June in the Arctic according to species). Newborn seals cannot swim and are easy to catch – thousands are massacred by hunters and in culls each year by simply walking among them on the ice and clubbing them.

Out of the breeding season, breathing holes in the ice are the best place to catch seals; recognize them by their cone shape (narrower on the upper surface). In thicker ice they will be surrounded by flipper and toothmarks where the seal has been keeping the hole open. You have to be patient, yet ever ready, for the visits to the hole are brief. Club the animal then enlarge the hole to recover the carcass.

Seals provide food, clothing, moccasins and blubber for fires. Adult males have a strong odour early in the year, but it does not affect their meat.

Eat all except the liver, which at some times of the year has DANGEROUS concentrations of vitamin A. Cook seal meat to avoid Trichinosis.

<figure>
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image013.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Seals are an excellent source of food on polar ice, and can be caught relatively easily upon the ice floes. In addition to providing sustenance, the pelts of seals may be used to make clothing or moccasins. Seal blubber is an excellent fuel – a square foot will burn for several hours.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Preparing meat

Bleed, gut and skin while the carcass is still warm. Roll hides before they freeze. Cut meat into usable portions and allow to freeze. Do not keep reheating. Once cooked, eat leftovers cold (that’s why you cut it up). Leave fat on all animals except seals. Fat is essential in cold areas but, if you eat a lot, make sure you take plenty of fluids. Except in extreme cold (when it will freeze) remove seal fat and render it down before it turns rancid. It can also be useful fire fuel.

When food is scarce animals will steal it – so cache it carefully. If there are signs of would-be thieves look out for them – they could be your next meal.

Rodents, especially squirrels, and rabbits and hares, can carry tularemia, which can be caught from ticks or handling infected animals. Wear gloves when skinning. Boiled flesh is safe.

### Arctic health

Frostbite, hypothermia and snow blindness are the main hazards, while efforts to keep warm and exclude draughts can lead to lack of oxygen and carbon monoxide poisoning.

It is easy to withdraw from reality, layered in clothing and with the head wrapped in a hood. Thinking can become sluggish and obvious things overlooked. Keep ‘switched on’. Keep active – but avoid fatigue and conserve energy for useful tasks. Sleep as much as possible – the cold will wake you before you freeze unless you are completely exhausted and cannot regenerate the heat you lose to the air.

Don’t let the cold demoralize you. Think up ways to improve the shelter, how to make a better pair of gloves, for instance. Exercise fingers and toes to improve circulation.

Don’t put off defecation – constipation is often brought on that way. Do try to time it conveniently before leaving your shelter, so that you can take waste out with you.

:::info[avoiding frostbite]

- Wrinkle face to stop stiff patches forming, pulling muscles in every direction. Exercise hands.
- Watch yourself and others for patches of waxy, reddening or blackened skin, especially on faces, ears, hands.
- AVOID tight clothing which will reduce circulation.
- Dress inside warmth of sleeping bag (if you have one).
- Never go out without adequate clothing – however briefly. Avoid getting clothing wet, through sweat or water. Dry it as soon as possible if this happens.
- Knock snow off before entering shelter, or leave outer clothing at entrance. Snow will melt in warmth giving you more clothing to dry.
- Wear gloves and keep them dry. NEVER touch metal with bare hands.
- AVOID spilling petrol on bare flesh. In sub-zero temperatures it will freeze almost at once and does even more damage than water because of its lower melting point.
- Be especially careful if you have been working hard and are fatigued. If you are sick – REST.

## **Mountains**

> **Mountain peaks are exposed to high winds and often covered in snow. They provide neither food nor shelter. Climbing rock and negotiating ice and snowfields calls for special skills, which are best learned first-hand in mountaineering schools and practised under supervision. No inexperienced person should think of trying to tackle real mountaineering territory, except as a learner with a properly organized party. But disaster may leave you on a mountainside or force you to cross a mountain range to get to safety.**

If no rescue is likely, the first aim in daylight should be to get down into the valleys where food and shelter are available. At night and in bad visibility this is too dangerous. Some kind of shelter must be found until visibility improves.

Dig into the snow if there is no shelter among rocks and no wreckage to provide cover. If below the snow line you must cover yourself to prevent exposure. A plastic bag will make an improvised sleeping bag, if you have no survival kit. Salvage blankets or covering from a crashed plane or use any clothing to cover yourself as much as possible, but do not pull clothes too tightly round you; air within the clothes will provide insulation.

On a slope, sleep with your head uphill; on rough and stony ground sleep on your stomach for greater comfort.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
Equipped with knowledge of proper climbing techniques and specialized climbing tools, it is possible to take on even the most challenging of sheer rockfaces.
</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Judging terrain

As you descend a mountainside it will often be difficult to see what is below you. Can you move around a valley or along a spur to look back at what was below? The opposite side of a valley will give you some idea of what is on your side too.

Be cautious if you find you are looking at a distant slope beyond a foreground bluff, the ground is likely to fall steeply between. Scree slopes can be particularly deceptive and appear continuous until you are very close to a cliff.

#### Descent

Negotiating cliffs without a rope is extremely dangerous. On the steepest cliffs it is necessary to come down facing the cliff and very difficult to see footholds below. If there is an adjoining slope, a colleague can observe and give directions. Once down, you can then point out holds to others from below. A high cliff should never be attempted. In the case of a plane crash there is probably more risk in climbing than waiting for rescue.

To climb down rockfaces which are less steep and with deeper ledges, adopt a sideways position using the inside hand for support. For easier crags, descend facing outwards with the body bent and where possible carry weight on the palms of the hands.

#### Ascent

Climbing upwards, holds are easier to see, but it is always safer to go round than over obstacles if you are travelling without knowing the route. You could get stuck with an impossible descent.

Always work out your route from the bottom and in climbing keep the body away from the rock and look up. Move only one hand or one foot at a time – always keep three points of contact. Keep your weight evenly balanced on the feet rather than hang from the hands. Do not overstretch.

With the feet firmly planted on the rock and one hand grasping a good hold, reach with the other for a hold just above the head. Test it and then look for another hold for the other hand or the feet. Use small intermediate holds, avoid becoming spread-eagled and let the legs do most of the work. Always place the feet as flat as possible to make maximum contact with the rock.

To climb vertically up fissures, use the chimney technique. Place your back against one surface and wedge your legs across the gap to the other. Slowly move up. If a chimney opens out you may have great difficulty in transferring to one face and have to descend again.

:::tip[survival tip]

Make sure that you are in a firm position before hauling the rope down – its sudden weight could affect your balance – and be sure that you have planned your next move. Once the rope is down you may have no way of retracing your steps.

:::

#### Descending by rope

With a rope firmly anchored at the upper level, it is possible to descend the sheerest cliff. The technique, known as abseiling or rappelling, can involve a special sit sling and a karabiner for the rope to pass through, but the basic method uses just a doubled rope. The rope does not move – you move down it. It is not comfortable, even with the body correctly angled, but it is the safest way to negotiate steep or very slippery slopes. Friction can damage clothing and skin, so if you can, pad out your shoulders and groin, and wear gloves.

The length of the rope controls the amount of descent and there must be a firm anchor point, a rock, or tree which can carry the weight and not cut the rope. If a series of platforms with firm anchors can be found, a slope can be negotiated in stages – but if several people are involved there must be room for all of them to wait at each stage.

After an abseil the rope can be pulled down after you. If someone is left above to untie the rope, or you are prepared to leave it behind, an undoubled rope can be used – making twice the descent possible with the same rope. Getting over the edge is often the most difficult part. You may have to climb down a few steps to gain a good position and sufficient confidence.

Loop rope around firm anchor (test it with full body weight). Avoid sharp edges that could cut rope. Pass both ends of rope between legs from front, bring around to left of body and across chest, over right shoulder and down across back. Hold rope in front with left hand and at back with right. Plant feet about 45cm (18in) apart, firmly against slope and lean back. Let rope around body carry your weight. Do not try to support yourself with your upper hand. Step slowly downwards. The lower hand controls rate of descent. Pay the rope out one hand at a time.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image016.webp" />

Caution: Abseiling can be dangerous. If not trained in the technique, NEVER attempt it, unless accompanied by an expert or in a survival situation.

#### Using a cradle

On an unobstructed vertical descent, a cradle made from a bowline-on-the-bight (see [Knots](/sas-survival-guide/ssg-making-camp#knots)) can be used to lower people down, or haul them up. Use this technique to rescue anyone who has fallen down a crevasse.

#### Ascending with ropes

Belaying is a method of helping others to climb up. First, one person must make the ascent with a rope (this could be a light line to haul up the actual rope afterwards) attached around the waist with a bowline. At each stage of the ascent there must be a platform or ledge to accommodate all the party and a secure anchor for the rope. If there are a number of lengths of rope a series of stages could be operated at the same time to handle a larger party.

Test that the anchor is firm – a tree, spike of rock or thread (a hole through rock, or a stone or small boulder firmly wedged in a crevice). Anchor the rope with a loop tied in a figure-of-eight or an overhand knot.

The belayer ties on with a bight or two bights to steady himself, and passes climbing rope over head and down to hips, making a twist around the arm closest to the anchor and takes up any slack. The climber ties on with a bowline around waist and begins to mount. The belayer takes in rope to keep it taut.

The anchor, belayer and climber should be in a straight line. If a spike is used it should be higher than the belayer’s head. If this is not possible standing, the belayer should work from a sitting position.

Older people and children should be roped around the chest. Small children are best carried papoose-style on another climber’s back.

Note: Belaying without an anchor is risky and requires more strength. The rope should then only pass through the belayer’s fingers, NOT around the back, lest the belayer be pulled down by the climber.

FALLING ROCK CAN KILL!

- On loose rock always test holds gently and never pull outwards on a loose hold.
- Be careful that your rope does not dislodge rocks.
- Even small falling rocks can inflict serious injury. If you knock a piece down, shout a warning to those below.

:::

#### Taking up rope

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image017.webp" />

Pull with both hands so that rope passes behind back (pull in with right hand, push away with left). Slide right hand out for more rope. Bring hands together and hold both parts of rope in right hand, while the left slides in towards body to take up slack. Begin again, pulling in with right hand, pulling rope around body with left. Be ready to arrest rope, in case climber falls. Bring rope tight around body by bringing hands together.

### Snow and icefields

Sophisticated equipment is available for climbing in snow and ice, but on snow some of the mountaineer’s ice-axe techniques can be improvised with a stout stick – a handled walking stick may give more grip than a simple shaft. If not equipped with a proper ice axe and crampons and skilled in their use, try to keep clear of mountain ice.

An ice axe or stick, driven into the snow when climbing, gives stability. On steep slopes climb in zig-zags, kicking steps and digging your stick in sideways. Dig in heels and use a stick on slighter slopes. On gentle slopes use heels and stick as a walking stick. On steep slopes descend backwards driving stick into snow for support and as a brake if you slip. Sliding down a snow slope is exhilarating, but dangerous.

Digging in the heels will help control speed and a stick driven into the snow is an additional brake – but there is always a risk that you have not seen a precipice ahead! Never use this method where there is any risk of avalanche.

#### Security ropes on ice

Any party moving across a glacier should be tied together, at not less than 9m (30ft) intervals. The leader should probe the snow with a stick, for any slight depression could indicate a crevasse.

Ropes fixed to a firm anchor at both ends can steady movement across ice patches which have to be traversed. Use as a hand hold, or tie a short rope in a bowline around the waist and secure to the rope with a prusik knot. This will slide along the rope to allow descent but, if you slip, will arrest your fall. This is a technique also useful on scree and loose descents for children and the less able.

#### Ice and snow bollards

If no firm rock is available for belaying, an upper anchor can be cut from the ice. Cut in a mushroom shape where natural ice formation makes it easiest. Make the diameter at least 40cm (16in) and depth at least 15cm (6in). Discard and start again at the slightest sign of a crack in the ice.

A snow bollard must be much bigger: at least 30cm (1ft) deep and from 1m (3ft) wide in hard snow to 3m (10ft) in soft. Pack equipment and baggage around it to prevent rope cutting through.

#### Crevasses

Crevasses are found where a glacier starts at a valley wall, changes direction or spreads out in a widening valley. Travel slowly, probing the ground. If one of the group falls through the snow he is belayed by a rope and can be hauled out.

Pressure of the rope on the chest can cause asphyxiation. Pass a rope down with a loop to put a foot in to take the weight. If the faller is unconscious it will take three people to heave him out. Manharness hitches will enable them to pull together. Temperatures in a crevasse are very low and the victim will rapidly weaken. Speed is important.

:::info[main areas of danger]

- Snow-covered convex slopes. Here the snow is under tension.

:::

### Avalanches

Avalanches are a serious hazard in all high mountain regions. They most frequently occur on slopes of between 20° and 60°, and especially between 30° and 45°, usually within 24 hours of a snow fall.

Several things trigger avalanches, such as temperature, ground conditions and noise. If you find yourself in avalanche-prone areas be aware of these causes. Avoid if possible areas where fresh snow has just fallen on steep ground. After a major fall, waiting 24 hours for it to settle will help. The majority of victims of avalanches start them off themselves.

Rain, or a rise in temperature, after a snowfall greatly increases the risk. The melting process helps to lubricate the slide. Heavy snow falling during low temperature can also avalanche because it does not have enough time to stabilize.

Slopes with irregular surfaces are safest and timbered slopes are also stable. Steep rocks at the top of a slope make it more prone to slipping, because falling snow, rocks or icicles can set it in motion. On a convex slope the gravitational movement downward compacts the snow at the bottom and creates tension at the top making it more likely to slip. Where snow is building up on the lee side of a ridge or the head of steep gullies, it’s under tension and the slightest disturbance can cause it to slide. Slopes with rocky outcrops and trees are safer to cross than bare ones. Carefully choose the best place to cross and before committing yourself, test the snow.

Dig in your stick/ice axe and see if it’s compacted or in layers. Throw rocks and make noise to try to encourage a slide, making sure you are well protected. On all dangerous ground it is best to rope together and use belays. Keep at least 15m (50ft) apart to help spread the load. If possible, let one person go across the more dangerous areas alone paying out the rope as he goes. When he is across he belays himself before the next person crosses.

Never make camp on the lee side of a convex slope, a concave slope is safer.

As a precaution always carry a location beacon that emits a signal that rescuers can use to find you. Also carry an avalanche tape that can be streamed out in an emergency. It is made of bright nylon tape and makes detection easier if buried.

:::info[Precautions]

- The heat of the sun on the snow can cause avalanches so before noon travel in shaded areas – keep off those exposed to the sun.
- After noon, keep to slopes that have been exposed, avoiding those that are now in sun for the first time.
- Avoid small gullies and valleys with steep side walls.
- Stick to ridges and high ground above avalanche paths – you are more likely to trigger a slide but, if you do, have a better chance of being on top of the debris or not being carried down at all.
- Always look out for avalanche activity, even if you do not see it happening. Assess where avalanches started, their direction, how long ago they took place. They will be a guide to where other avalanches are likely.
- A mud slide is very similar to an avalanche, but instead of tons of snow, masses of mud sliding on water bury all in its path. Avoid low-lying areas and watercourses. Stay on the spurs and ridges. If caught up in a slide, use swimming actions to stay on top and go feet first.

Lichens are an important survival food, not only in arctic regions – though vital there because they are probably more nutritious than other arctic plants. Explorers have survived on Rock Tripe for long periods. But beware! They can cause painful irritation if eaten raw because they contain a bitter acid. Remove it by soaking them in water overnight and then boiling thoroughly. A further roasting will crispen them up if you prefer a crunchy texture.

If you successfully hunt a caribou eat the fermented lichens in its stomach. They are easily digested and some Eskimos count them a great delicacy.

### Arctic shelter

In polar areas simple shelters will be those already waiting for you in natural caves and hollows. If you carry some kind of bivouac in your equipment, you can erect it and increase its protection by piling up loose snow around and over it, so long as it can support the weight. But to build in hard snow – and at very low temperatures snow will be solid – you need some kind of implement to cut into it or make blocks from it. Spades and ice saws are essential equipment for polar expeditions.

Snow or rock caves will be easily recognizable – but not so obvious are the spaces left beneath the spreading boughs of conifers in the northern forests when the snow has already built up around them.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image032.webp" />

A medium-sized tree may have a space right around the trunk (a) or a large one have pockets in the snow beneath a branch. Try digging under any tree with spreading branches on the lee side.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image033.webp" />

Even soft snow can be built into a windbreak. Those with equipment can cut blocks (b). This is the minimum shelter for the minimum effort. Anchor a ground sheet or poncho along the top with another course of blocks, use others to secure the bottom edge. Use more snow blocks to close the sides.

:::tip[building in snow]

A saw, knife, shovel or machete is necessary to cut compacted snow into blocks. The ideal snow will bear a man’s weight without much impression being made but be soft enough to allow a probe to be inserted evenly through it.

Cut blocks about 45 x 50cm (18 x 20in) and 10–20cm (4–8in) thick. These will be an easy size to handle, thick enough to provide good insulation and yet allow maximum penetration of the sun’s rays.

:::

:::info[surviving the cold]

No matter how low the external temperature, inside a well-constructed snow house the temperature will not drop lower than –10°C (0°F). Just burning a candle will raise the temperature by about four degrees. The traditional Eskimo way of heating the igloo was a wick in a bowl of fat. In a large shelter with a wood fire the temperature is cosy. An oil burner or fat on bones are good alternatives where there is no wood.

:::

#### Snow trench

This is a much quicker shelter to construct than trying to build in snow above the ground, but it is suitable for only one person and then only for short-term use – while you are on the move or making something bigger, for example.

Mark out an area the size of a sleeping bag (including head support) and cut out blocks the whole width of the trench. Dig down to a depth of at least 60cm (2ft). Along the top of the sides of the trench cut a ledge about 15cm (6in) wide and the same deep.

Rest the snow bricks on each side of the ledge and lean them in against each other to form a roof (a). Put equipment below your sleeping bag so that you are not in direct contact with the snow beneath.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image034.webp" />

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image035.webp" />

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image036.webp" />

Block the windward end with another block or piled-up snow. At the other end (downwind) have a removable block as a door (b), or dig an entrance (c). Fill any gaps with snow. Most effective built on a slight slope. Cold air will collect in the entrance leaving warmer air in the sleeping space.

#### Snow cave

Dig into a drift of firm snow to make a comfortable shelter. Make use of the fact that hot air rises and heavier, cold air sinks. Create three levels inside: build a fire on the highest, sleep on the centre one and keep off the lower level which will trap the cold. Drive a hole through the roof to let out smoke and make another hole to ensure that you have adequate ventilation.

Use a block of snow as a door and keep it loose fitting and on the INSIDE so that it will not freeze up and jam. If it does, a block on the inside will be much easier to free.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image040.webp" />

#### Snow house (igloo)

An igloo takes time to construct but centuries of use by the Eskimo demonstrate its efficiency. Build the main shelter first then dig out an entrance or build an entry tunnel which is big enough to crawl along. Make sure that its entrance does not point into the wind. You could bend the tunnel or build a windbreak to make this less likely.

To construct an igloo by the circular method, mark out a circle on the ground about 4m (13¼ft) in diameter and tramp it down to consolidate the floor as you proceed with the rest of the building. 

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/sas-survival/03_polar/image041.webp" />

Cut and lay a circle of blocks on the perimeter. Be prepared to dig a tunnel (a), or leave a space for an entrance (b). Place another layer on top of them but, as when laying bricks, centre new blocks over the previous vertical joint.

Build up more layers but place each only halfway over the lower tier, so that the igloo tapers in or becomes dome-shaped. Shape out the entrance arch as you proceed. Seal the top with a flat block. Make ventilation holes near the top and near the bottom – not on the side of the prevailing wind or so low that snow rapidly builds up and blocks it. Fill any other gaps with snow. Smooth off all the inside to remove any drip-points. This will allow any condensation to run down the wall instead of dripping off.

#### Igloo (spiral method)

Lay the first course of blocks and then shape them to the required spiral. You do not have to overhang the blocks if you angle your initial spiral downwards and inwards, and shape the top and bottom faces of subsequent courses to lean inwards. The last few blocks in the centre may need some support as you fit them into position.

:::tip[living in a snow house]

- In bad weather make sure that you have a good supply of timber, or liquid fuel, inside the shelter.
- Do not carry loose snow into the shelter, knock it off boots and clothing before you enter.
- Mark the entrance clearly so that it is easily found.
- Keep shovels and tools inside the shelter – you may have to dig yourself out.
- Drips in igloos can be stopped by placing a piece of snow on the source.
- Relieve yourself inside the shelter – this is usual practice in these conditions and conserves body heat. Use plastic bags, ration tins or other containers and empty when possible. Try to discipline the bowels to work just prior to leaving the shelter in the morning and then remove faecal matter with other rubbish accumulated.
- In a shelter with several people organize a rosta of duties. It is important that someone tends the fire at all times. Others can check the vent holes, gather fuel, go hunting when possible, prepare meals and so forth.
- Remember that at a low temperature you will need more food.

#### Inside the igloo

Cut an entrance way through the lower course of blocks or dig a tunnel beneath them. The central hole can be used as an entrance if you are too exhausted to complete the structure.

#### Parachute snow house

This is a useful structure if stranded on sea ice where sufficient snow for an igloo (or igloos) for a larger party may be hard to find. Look for snow or convenient blocks of ice in the pushed-up pressure ridges of the ice.

Mark out a circle and build up a circular wall of snow blocks about 1m (3ft) high. Leave an entrance space if on ice – you will not be able to dig an entrance tunnel. Dig a lower area in the floor for cold air to sink into.

:::note[Case study: survival story]

In the mid-1960s I was training a new army unit in Kenya. This training involved tactics, field craft and navigation. They were all experienced soldiers but lacked knowledge in small group operations. The training area was in the Northern Frontier district of Kenya, a very hot and dry area.

The recruits were dropped off in groups of 4 and had to navigate across country to a series of rendezvous points (RVs), where they were given water. My job with 3 others was to man these RVs, ensuring that everyone was accounted for and in good health. Each recruit was given half a pint of water strictly issued from a jerry can which held 4.5 gallons (36 pints). On the third day the heat was taking its toll and everyone was complaining of various ailments like blisters, sores caused by backpacks and fatigue. But one student was particularly bad. He was delirious and verging on the point of collapse. While I was treating him, his partner grabbed a jerry can and tried to swallow the lot. What he couldn’t swallow he spilt, and by the time we wrestled the can from him it was almost empty. This was the last of our supplies and there were still more than 30 men to come. The nearest source of water was 3 days away and with no re-supply possible the exercise turned from hard to critical. Although all the recruits came from nearby areas, they had no water discipline, which we found out to our cost.

By strictly rationing and sending the strongest for help, everyone survived, but it’s a lesson they will never forget.

**LESSONS LEARNT**

- Never underestimate the power of self-preservation
- Protect your water supply
- Enforce strict rationing
- Of all the discomforts, thirst is the deadliest.
- When treating a person with dehydration, wet their lips first and look for a gag reflex (swallowing). Administer small sips only. When giving treatment, always make sure the patient is lying down in any available shade.
