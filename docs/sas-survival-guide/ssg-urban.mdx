:::info[DISASTER]

Whether a small-scale accident or a mammoth disaster – both may bring about a life-or-death situation – the same
disciplines and quick thinking are needed.

To show the way in which basic survival strategies are applied to every kind of situation, a series of individual
small-scale vehicle incident procedures are outlined with strategies to deal with them.

The same approaches can be seen on a far wider scale in the handling of a major air crash. In these circumstances
the survivor is more likely to find him- or herself in unfamiliar territory and involved with a greater number of
people for a longer period.

Accidents or isolation are not the only causes of a survival situation. There are many natural and man-made forces
which can produce disasters demanding the same survival skills. Drought, fire, earthquake and flood, for instance,
can strike both in the remote survival camp and at home. The survivor should know the techniques for dealing with a
forest fire but it is just as important to know how to escape from a burning building or even the site of a bomb
explosion.

Home front faces the problems of coping with survival on your own doorstep if the services and supplies on which we
normally depend are cut off.
:::

## **Strategy**

Good planning and preparation enable the survivor to confront difficulties and dangers that pose a serious threat to
survival. They become contingencies for which you are equipped. But you cannot anticipate everything. You must be ready
to respond rapidly to the unexpected danger and to deal with potential disaster rationally and realistically. You must
overcome the tendency to panic and take the action appropriate to the situation.

Sometimes a collision or other accident occurs with no warning of any kind, but in most instances there is a moment of
realization that something is going to happen and it is in that moment that instinctive reaction can save lives. In many
situations there is a considerable time in which an awareness of potential disaster can develop and that is when the
panic reaction is probably most dangerous.

As mist closes in on a hillside, reducing visibility to almost nothing and making it easy to lose any sense of
direction, most people would begin to panic at the thought that they are going to be trapped. They begin to do foolish
things and increase their danger. They should, however, already be assessing the possibilities and looking for some
suitable shelter in which to wait until conditions become safe to continue. Keeping calm, in the knowledge that you have
the ability to handle the situation, will not only enable you to see it through but also to see other solutions.

Some situations are predictable and knowledge of the techniques for handling them will minimize the risks. Learn them,
they may save your life. They may take considerable nerve – like waiting for the right moment to escape from a car that
is sinking under water – but they are based on experience. The answer to more general survival problems, however, will
often lie in inspired improvisation drawing on those skills appropriate to the situation.

Disaster may involve you in a contained situation which you must handle alone – or you may find yourself one of hundreds
of people in a large-scale disaster over which there can be no control at all.

### People

For an expedition, the planning will include a careful selection of compatible personalities, selected for their
fitness, both physically and in experience and training, for the particular project. In a disaster situation anyone may
react unexpectedly under stress. With a mishap affecting members of the general public there may be a very varied group
of people thrown together. Men, women and children, elderly people and babies. There may be pregnant women and people
with medical problems or physical disabilities that require particular attention. The accident situations which involve
such a varied group are also likely to involve a higher risk of injuries than among a hand-picked group of the trained
and fit.

Babies may look very fragile – but they are very tough. However, they must be kept warm and fed regularly. Children will
need reassuring and comforting, especially if they have lost the people with them or they are themselves in pain. Often
the adventure of the situation will help to keep them from becoming too worried and it will help to keep them occupied,
but they should not be allowed to wander, to play with fire or otherwise expose themselves to further danger. Old people
are usually mentally tough and can give reassurance to the young, but they must be kept warm and fed regularly. It often
seems true that women handle emergencies much better than men and are able to accept responsibility for others more
easily.

With a ship or commercial airline the ship’s officers or flight crew can be expected to take charge of the situation, if
they are among the survivors, but there will not be the military chain of command or the acceptance of leadership and
responsibility which can be expected in a compact organized group.

Some democratic procedure to make decisions, plan action and maintain morale must be attempted.

The trauma of the experience may leave some people eager to follow any leadership which gives them hope, but it will
also throw into relief antagonisms and prejudices which must be overcome.

In an air or sea disaster people of different cultures and backgrounds may be thrown together and forced into situations
which their own social taboos would not permit. Considerable tact may be necessary to overcome these problems. SURVIVAL,
however, must take precedence.

The wider your medical knowledge the better, but giving people the will to survive is important and much of this can be
achieved by a good ‘bedside manner’ – if you can give the impression that you know what you are doing you are half-way
there.

Calmness and confidence in yourself will inspire the confidence and cooperation of others. The more knowledge you have
the better you will be able to cope.

:::info SURVIVAL SCENARIO
If the weather or conditions in your camp change, should you revise your survival strategy?
You should have a strategy for every scenario, therefore as situations change, so should your strategy. You must be flexible and be
prepared to adapt.
:::

## **Car accident survival**

**In the United States alone, over 40,000 people die each year in car accidents. Here's how to maximise your chances of
survival should the brakes in your car fail, if your car is in water or if you break down on railway tracks.**

### Brake failure

If brakes fail while driving, change gear and apply the handbrake. You must do several things at once: take your foot
off the accelerator, flick the switch of your warning lights, pump the footbrake rapidly (it may still connect), change
down through the gears and apply handbrake pressure. Don’t slam the brake on, begin with gentle bursts, gradually
braking harder until you stop.

If there is no time for all this, take your foot off the accelerator and change down through the gears – and grab the
handbrake – but DON’T apply maximum pressure until you are sure that you won’t skid.

Look out for escape lanes and places where you can leave the road, preferably a soft bank or a turning that has an
uphill slope.

If speed remains unchecked, on a steep hill for example, brush the car along a hedge or wall to reduce speed. Take
advantage of a vehicle in front and use it to stop you – run into it as gently as the situation allows. Use warning
lights, blow your horn and flash your headlights to give the driver in front as much warning as possible that you are on
a collision course.

#### Collision

![ ](/images/SASSurvial_image002.webp)

If collision seems inevitable, stay with it and steer the car to do as little damage to others and yourself as possible.
Try to avoid a sudden stop by driving into something which will give, like a fence or a hedge rather than a tree.

Seat belts (compulsory in most countries) will help stop you hitting the windscreen. Most new cars are usually fitted
with airbags for both the driver and the front passenger. Given the speed and force with which an airbag inflates, it is
vitally important that you do not sit too close to the steering wheel. And if your steering wheel is adjustable, tilt it
downwards so that the airbag points towards your chest rather than your head, but make sure you can see the instruments
clearly.

If neither of these options are available, adopting the brace position will offer you the best chance of survival in a
crash because it stops you from impacting too heavily on the interior of the car. The important thing is to get your
upper torso as low as possible. There are two alternative types of brace position depending on the space that you are
in.

The first position requires you to place your head on you knees, while your hands hold on to your lower legs. The second
position is more useful if you are driving the car. Place your hands on the steering wheel, then, place your forehead
onto the back of your hands before the impact.

#### Jumping out

Do NOT try to jump out of a runaway car unless you know it to be headed for a cliff or another substantial drop and that
you will not survive the impact. If this is the only available option, then open the door, undo the safety belt, and
begin to roll yourself into a ball. Drop from the car in a rolling movement. Do not resist the ground but keep balled up
and continue the roll.

### CAR UNDER WATER

If possible abandon the car before it sinks, for it will not sink immediately and will take time to fill. Water pressure
on the outside makes it very difficult to open the door so open the window if you can and wriggle out of it. It takes
great presence of mind to manage that when subject to the shock and surprise of the ‘splash down’, but if there are
small children in the car it may be possible to push one through. Do not try to save possessions.

If you have not been fast enough CLOSE the window firmly, get children to stand and lift babies near to the roof.
Release seat belts and tell everyone by a door to be ready with a hand on the handle. Release at once any automatic door
locks or master locks. Water could prevent them from working. Do not attempt to open doors at this stage.

As water fills the interior, air will be trapped near the roof. The water pressure inside the car will nearly equalize
the pressure with that of the water outside the car. As the car comes to rest and is nearly full of water tell everyone
to take a deep breath, open the doors and swim to the surface, breathing out as they do so. Everyone leaving through the
same door should link arms. If you have to wait for someone to get out before you, hold your breath for that moment.

precaution: Always park alongside water, not running towards it. If you have to park a car facing water then leave it in
reverse gear and with the handbrake on (if facing away from water, in first gear with the handbrake on).

### CAR ON RAILWAY TRACKS

If a car breaks down on an unmanned level crossing, put it into gear and use the starter motor to jerk it clear. This
will work with a manual gear change but not with an automatic. If a train is approaching abandon the car, carry children
or infirm persons to safety and keep away – about 45m (50yds) should be far enough – for if a train is travelling at
high speed it could fling car wreckage quite a distance.

If there is no train visible, or you can see one several miles in the distance, you must try to avert the collision. If
the car can be moved by pushing, push it clear of all tracks – you cannot be sure which one the train will be on. If
there is an emergency telephone warn signalmen further down the track of the situation. If not, walk up the track
towards the train. Stand well to one side (high speed trains have quite a slipstream) and wave a car blanket or bright
coloured garment to warn the driver. If he is doing his job properly he will know that he is approaching a crossing and
should look ahead to see that all is clear.

## **DISASTER IN THE AIR**

**A plane crash or forced landing in difficult terrain is one of the most dramatic of disaster scenarios. Since it could
happen anywhere the individual cannot prepare for any specific situation.**

**Airline cabin staff are trained for such emergencies and you should follow their instructions. Aircrew will be trying
to land the plane as safely as possible; there is nothing you can do except to keep calm and support the crew in calming
the other passengers.**

To prepare for a crash-landing, tighten the seat belt, link arms with people on either side, hold your chin firmly down
on your chest, lean forwards over a cushion, folded blanket or coat, interlink legs with your neighbours if seating
permits it and brace yourself for impact.

When the aircraft finally stops moving – and not before – evacuate the aircraft as instructed in the pre-flight brief.
If a ground landing, then quickly get away from the immediate area of the plane, as there is danger of fire or
explosion. Even if there is no fire, keep away until the engines have cooled and any spilled fuel evaporated.

If ditching into water, dinghies will be automatically inflated and anchored on the wings. Do not inflate your own
lifejacket while you are in the aircraft. To do so would restrict your exit. Wait until you are in the water and then
pull the toggle to inflate it and get into a dinghy.

If the plane is sinking, release the dinghy from its anchorage as soon as passengers and equipment are stowed. As you
leave the plane the more kit you can take with you the better. But do not stop to gather personal belongings and
luggage.

### After the crash

However self-disciplined you are, the entry into this kind of survival situation will be dramatic, abrupt and confusing.
You will be in a state of shock and may be on the verge of panic. If there is fire or the risk of fire or explosion,
keep at a distance until that danger seems to have passed, but no further away than seems necessary for safety. Do not
allow anyone to smoke if fuel has been spilled. You must not blunder off into unknown terrain, especially at night, and
need to maintain contact with other survivors.

Move injured persons to a safe distance with you and try to account for all the people involved. The immediate treatment
of the injured is a priority. Treat cases in order of severity of their injuries and with each individual deal first
with breathing difficulties, then in sequence, with major bleeding, wounds, fractures and shock.

Separate the dead from the living if possible – the deaths are part of the frightening strangeness of the event and the
survivors will be easier to calm down.

Even with a fire, all may not have been destroyed. Investigate the wreckage and salvage whatever you can of equipment,
food, clothing and water. Take NO risks if there is still a chance that fuel tanks could ignite and beware of any
noxious fumes from wreckage which has been smouldering.

If you have to wait for fire to burn out, take stock of the location in which you find yourself – which should in any
case be the next step in your strategy. Is it practical and safe to remain where you are?

If your anticipated route is known – and with a flight it will be – some kind of search and rescue operation can be
expected and there are considerable advantages in staying where you are. Searchers will already have some idea of your
location, and even if you have been forced off route they will have a record of your last reported position. The
wreckage or grounded plane will be more noticeable from the air, especially in heavily wooded country where even a large
group of people will be hidden by the trees.

If you find that you are in a very exposed or dangerous location then a move to a more protected position is necessary.
However, do not move at night unless the threat to life outweighs the risks of trying to negotiate unknown terrain in
the dark.

The usual reason for making an immediate move will be because you are in an exposed position on a mountain or hillside
offering no protection from the elements, or at risk from rock falls or other dangers there. Move down, not up the
slope, as conditions are likely to be less exposed on lower ground.

Do not all go off looking for a safer location. Send out scouts to investigate the surrounding terrain carefully. They
must keep together, working in pairs, and not go off on individual explorations. They can maintain contact vocally and
should mark their routes as they proceed so that they can easily retrace their steps.

Remember this, it may save your life one day:

N &ndash; Navigation
:::

### Protection

The first requirement will probably be some immediate shelter from the elements, especially for any injured. A more extended reconnaissance can
follow to choose a proper campsite. Make the most of any natural shelter and augment it by using whatever materials are at hand.

If injuries are too severe for a person to be moved, some kind of shelter must be provided for them on the spot.

On bare ground, if there is no equipment or wreckage which can be utilized, then the only thing to do is dig down.

If possible, find a natural hollow and burrow deeper, using the excavated earth to build up the sides. This will at least get a casualty out of
the wind. Get a fire going to provide warmth (it will also help raise morale) and use reflectors to maximize the heating effect, enabling you to
conserve fuel.

If the circumstances make movement away unnecessary or impossible, follow similar procedures. Build up rocks, wreckage or equipment to form a
windbreak if no natural shelter is available.

If in a group huddle together, it will reduce the loss of body heat. Survival time for badly injured persons in these circumstances is limited and
you must hope for an early rescue. Fit people must go off in search of water, fuel, shelter materials and food &ndash; but always in at least
pairs. Lay out as many signals as possible to attract attention.

Remember that shelter may be as necessary from the sun as it is from the wind and cold. Exposure is not only a matter of hypothermia.

### Location

If you have a radio or mobile phone you can signal for help &ndash; but do not go back on board a damaged and potentially explosive aircraft to do
so. Wait until you are sure it is quite safe. The rescue party will want to know your location. Those who were travelling overland should have a
good idea of their position &ndash; even if temporarily lost &ndash; and with a map should be able to give a more accurate fix. If you are the
victim of disaster at sea or in the air, however, it will help considerably if you know your planned course and have some idea of your position
when disaster struck, as well as of wind or current directions.

As often as not you must light fires &ndash; three fires are an internationally recognized distress signal. Make them as large as possible. Lay
ground signals to attract attention, use pyrotechnics when you know help is within range and even make a noise when help is very near. This is
when you are glad that the responsible authorities were told of your intentions and that you kept precisely to your route. It is only a matter of
time before rescue comes. Meanwhile make yourself as comfortable as possible.

However, even the most careful plans may go astray. Navigational instruments could fail, storms, high winds or fog could all throw you off course
and there you are, safe in your shelter but with no one knowing where. You could have a longer wait than you anticipate and you need to provide
for it.

You also need to assess where you are on a more local scale, to study the terrain for anything it can tell you, not only to pin-point your
position &ndash; if that is possible &ndash; but to see if there are safer and more comfortable locations to pitch camp, sources for fuel, food
and water. In the long term you will also be assessing the possibility of making your own way across the land.

At sea you will be looking out for any indications that, rather than staying put, there is land close enough for your survival chances to be
greater if you try to reach it rather than holding your present position. But you are at the mercy of wind and current, though you can delay your
drift with a sea anchor.

### Acquiring food and water

On an isolated cliff ledge, cut off by the tide or forced by storm or mist to wait until you can move on, there may be little opportunity to
exploit natural resources. Do not tuck into emergency rations immediately. You may be there for some time and, hungry though you may be, you
should ration them out, allowing for a much longer wait than even a pessimistic assessment suggests. Even in such a situation there may be water
and food within reach.

Elsewhere save your emergency rations for when there is nothing else and tap nature&rsquo;s resources first. Do not just find one source of food.
Seek out a variety of plants for leaves, fruit, nuts, roots and other edible parts. Look for signs of animals which can be trapped or hunted.

When it is your very survival that is at stake there is no place for squeamishness about what you will or will not eat or about how you acquire
your food, but that does not mean that you should totally abandon concern for wildlife and the environment. When there is an abundance of other
choices there is no reason to take already endangered species for your food &ndash; animal or vegetable &ndash; nor to set traps (which cannot
discriminate in what they catch and maim) that will produce more meat than you can eat fresh or preserve. Making the most of nature&rsquo;s
resources does not mean plundering them. Over-exploitation will be to your own disadvantage if you have to stay in the area for a long time.

Remember, too, that the most easily obtained nutritious food may be quite different from what you usually eat. If you have already learned to eat
an unusual diet as part of your training you will find it much easier to feed yourself and will be able to encourage others to eat the same
things.

Fuel for a fire will be needed for boiling water even if the temperature does not demand a fire for warmth &ndash; but do not be deluded into
thinking that a warm day is going to be followed by a warm night. There can be dramatic temperature changes from day to night in some parts of the
world.

### Navigation

The first thing to do is to coordinate signals (flares or fires, for example) so that you are best prepared to receive rescue. Then organize
water, food, and shelter.

You should stay where you are and only consider moving if you&rsquo;re en route to a final destination.

The advantage of this is that you will be able to use any equipment and materials from the plane or vehicle and you will be able to use the
wreckage as shelter. Also it will be easier for you to be spotted from the air.

:::tip[SURVIVAL TIP]
On land, it is seldom most sensible to set out immediately to walk to safety, rather than wait for rescue. However, if you know that no
one will be aware that you are missing, if the terrain is so barren that it provides no food, water or shelter, or if you feel convinced
that your reserves of energy and rations are sufficient to see you back to civilization, or to a location where you are sure you will be
able to live off the land, you may decide to set off as soon as the light is good enough or conditions are otherwise right.
:::

:::tip[SURVIVAL TIP]
In the short-term water is much more vital than food for your survival. If fresh running water is not available there are many other
sources you can tap, but sterilize or boil to ensure that it is pure. Make finding water sources a priority.
:::

## **Drought**

**Drought, caused by long periods of dry weather or insufficient rainfall, creates desert in areas where it is a permanent condition. Elsewhere,
drought may be a regular seasonal feature for part of the year &ndash; and predictable year after year. Where it is balanced by a wet season,
water can be stored to last through the dry months. The underground stone-cut or concrete-built cisterns of ancient and modern Mediterranean
civilizations collect the rainfall of the wet season for the long dry summer.**

**In temperate regions, if rainfall drops far below the normal, periodic drought may be produced with vegetation unable to obtain water to
compensate for what it loses to the air. In cases where the dry spell may not be so obvious but there is still insufficient moisture to provide
that needed by the plants, a condition known as &lsquo;invisible drought&rsquo; occurs. The death of vegetation causes deprivation right through
the food chains that are based upon it. If the drought becomes severe, dead and dying animals may even pollute the water supplies that still
remain.**

#### Fire risk

The corpses of dead animals should be buried in deep graves. Dry ground can be very hard, but burying is the best way to remove these possible
sources of infection. They could be burned, but since drought leaves everything tinder-dry, the risk of fire spreading is considerable and it
could easily get out of hand. Each year fires rage in southern France, California and Australia and, without water to check the flames, they
spread rapidly. If you must have a fire, dig down to bare earth and keep the fire small and attended at all times.

#### Hygiene

In houses, lack of water for washing and sanitation can bring the risk of infection. If the water level in a water closet no longer seals the
S-bend, disease may spread from the sewers and personal hygiene may suffer from lack of washing. Do not use the WC but leave sufficient water in
the bowl to form a barrier. Make an outdoor latrine to use instead (see
_<a href="Papertrell://navigatetocomponent/e99924f2-747d-4b0d-b272-cafede422225?selector=00619">Camp Hygiene</a>)._

Sweating will help to keep pores open and free of dirt, but, even when you need all available water for drinking, try to clean hands after
defecation and before preparing food.

#### Store and conserve water

If a monsoon does not start at the expected time, or a hot dry summer produces a parching of the earth, take precautions by storing as much water
as possible and using it wisely. Keep it covered and shaded to avoid evaporation.

Dig a pit for a storage cistern in a shady spot, avoiding tree roots. Line it with a polythene sheet or with cement if available (but don&rsquo;t
fill it up until the cement has had a chance to thoroughly dry). If you live in a clay area, dig a pit and line it with clay. If you build the
concrete or clay up into a partial dome, it will help to keep the contents cool and leave a smaller opening to keep covered.

NEVER waste water. Water used for cooking can later be used for washing. Boil all drinking water. If a well runs dry you may gain more water by
digging deeper, but the further you dig, the further you deplete the water stored in the earth.

In areas with cold nights the drop in temperature may condense the moisture in the air. Use the techniques to catch it described for desert
survival.

High ground will show greater variation between day and night temperatures and will offer better chance of dew to collect in the early morning. It
may also offer the advantage of cool breezes.

Drought can strike anywhere. Even in areas of heavy rainfall, such as Assam, there has been drought when the monsoon has failed.

:::danger[SURVIVAL ADVICE]
If drought persists, especially over more than a year, desert conditions may begin to develop. Evacuation may be the only solution if
water supplies cannot be brought in.
:::

:::danger[WARNING]

- In conditions of severe drought be especially careful of contamination of water supplies. Disease from dead animals may be rampant.
    However thirsty you are, boil all water before drinking.
- Flies may be a serious problem at first &ndash; ensure that all foodstuffs are covered. Protect from dust, which may become a hazard
    as top soil is blown away.
- When nature is disturbed in this way, animals act abnormally. Crazed by thirst, normally docile creatures may attack you.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*To limit risk of infection, corpses of drought-stricken animals need to be removed or destroyed. Burning the bodies may be a sensible option.
However, because of the high risk of fires spreading out of control, it is probably safer to bury the carcasses in deep pits.*</figcaption>
</figure>

## **Fire**

Fire requires heat, fuel and oxygen and produces smoke, heat and toxic gases. It may spread by heating its surroundings through direct contact
(conduction), through rising gas and smoke (convection) or through heat rays (radiation). Convection is usually the most serious of these forms of
heat transfer.

The best protection from fire is prevention. Carelessness with lighted cigarettes and burning matches is the cause of many fires. The sun shining
through an abandoned bottle or a piece of broken glass can start a blaze in a dry season.

Fire can strike anywhere &ndash; at any time. Precautions should always be taken. Vehicles and buildings SHOULD ALWAYS be equipped with fire
extinguishers. Managed forestry plantations are divided by broad paths as fire breaks. Equipment for beating out flames should be found in
numerous places. YOU should know how to use it.

### FOREST FIRES

If you are present where a fire starts (or where a camp fire accidentally spreads) in woodland, or on heath or grassland, your first action should
be to SMOTHER IT.

The first sign of an approaching forest fire will be the smell of smoke. Then you will probably hear the fire before you see flames. You may
notice unusual animal behaviour before you realize the cause.

<figure className="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image004.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*Wildfires can reach temperatures nearing 800&deg;C (1,470&deg;F). They may spread rapidly, especially if there is a strong wind. Keep calm and
carefully choose an escape route by assessing the surrounding terrain and the wind direction to predict the possible movement of the fire.*</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Escape route

If caught in an area where fire is raging, and when it is far too late to put it out yourself, do NOT immediately flee &ndash; unless the fire is
so close that there is no choice.

Although you may feel that clothing hampers your movement, do NOT dismb-3 pb-0 alert it for it will shield you from the full force of radiated
heat.

Smoke will indicate the direction of the wind &ndash; the fire will be travelling fastest in that direction. If the wind is blowing away from you,
towards the fire move INTO the wind. Head for any natural fire break &ndash; such as where there is a swathe through the trees, where the flames
should be stopped. A river is the best break &ndash; even if the flames can leap it you will be reasonably safe in the water. In forestry
plantations look for the roadways and fire breaks.

Do NOT run wildly. Choose your escape route. Check the surrounding terrain and the wind direction to assess the possible spread of the fire.

If the wind is blowing towards you the fire is likely to travel more quickly &ndash; and the flames can leap a larger gap. Fire travels faster
uphill so do NOT make for high ground. Try to go around the fire if possible &ndash; but some forest fires burn on a front several kilometres
wide. If you can neither skirt or outdistance the blaze take refuge in a large clearing, deep ravine, watercourse or gulley.

#### Into the fire

Sometimes the best escape route may be to run THROUGH the flames. This is impossible if they are very intense and the area covered by the actual
fire is great. In a large clearing or on heathland, however, it may be possible to run through less dense fire to refuge on the already burned-out
land. Cover as much exposed skin as you can and if you have water available tip some over you to damp down clothing, hair and any flesh you have
not been able to cover. Dampen a piece of cloth to cover your nose and mouth.

Thick vegetation will burn fiercely and slow you down &ndash; so choose the spot for your breakthrough with care. Make your mind up, then do not
delay. Take a deep breath. Cover your nose and mouth to keep out smoke and RUN.

#### Going to earth

If there is no natural break or gully in which to shelter and the fire is too deep to think of running through it, you may have to seek the
protection of the earth itself.

People have survived fierce fires by digging themselves in and covering themselves with earth, allowing the fire to burn over the top of them. The
risk is considerable, not just from heat but from suffocation: fire burns up oxygen.

Scrape as much of a hollow as you can, throwing the earth on to a coat or cloth if you have one, then pull the cloth over you with its earth
covering. Cup your hands over your mouth and nose and breath through them. This won&rsquo;t increase the amount of oxygen, but it will cool down
and filter the very hot air and sparks, which can damage the respiratory system. Try to hold your breath as the fire passes over.

#### Stay in a vehicle

If caught in a forest fire in a vehicle, stay inside and keep the windows tightly shut. Turn off the ventilation system. The car will give you
some protection from radiant heat. Drive away from the fire if you can but, if immobilized, stay put.

People have survived by staying in a vehicle until the glass began to melt, by which time the fire had moved beyond them. If they had panicked and
run into the fire they would have died.

There is a danger of a petrol tank exploding but your chances are much greater than outside, if the fire is intense around the vehicle.

#### Fight fire with fire

It may be possible to use fire itself to create protection, if there is no way of getting out of the path of the fire or of going through it
&ndash; but it is still some distance away.

The technique is to burn a patch of ground before the main fire reaches it. With nothing left to ignite, the flames cannot advance, giving you a
place of refuge. The main fire must be sufficiently far away for your fire to burn a space it cannot jump before it arrives.

Light your own fire along as wide a line as possible &ndash; at least 10m (33ft) wide, but 100m (330ft) would be better. It will burn in the same
direction as the main fire, creating a break which you can move into. Make sure you determine the wind direction correctly.

:::tip[FIGHTING A FOREST FIRE]

In areas where there are forestry plantations you should see racks of fire-beating equipment at intervals along the main routes. This
consists of bundles of twigs (usually birch), tied in a broom, and spade-shaped beaters with rubber blades. They can be effective in
putting out the beginnings of a blaze.
:::

:::danger[WARNING]

Winds may be swirling and fires create their own draughts, so you may still have to make a dash through your own flames. The main fire
must be far enough away for your own fire to burn and pass. Do NOT underestimate the speed at which flames travel &ndash; they may be
approaching faster than you can run. Do NOT light another fire unless you are desperate and fairly certain of the outcome.

Despite the name, do NOT beat rapidly with them &ndash; that will only help to fan the flames and spread sparks. The object is to SMOTHER
the fire by bringing the beater down over the flames to extinguish them. The flat blades are particularly effective in smothering a fire
beginning among leaves and undergrowth.

If no equipment is available use a coat or blanket to smother the fire and to cut off oxygen from the flames &ndash; or use a leafy branch
to beat it out.
:::

### BURNING BUILDINGS

Smoke will usually be the first indication of fire. If the fire is still small, attempt to extinguish by covering with a blanket or thick curtain
(to deprive the flames of oxygen), or using sand, water or fire extinguisher as available and appropriate.

#### Electrical fires

If there is any possibility of a fire being caused by an electrical fault, do NOT use water until the power has been turned off, preferably at the
mains. Turn off gas at the mains too. If television sets or computer VDUs catch fire do NOT use water on them. Even after being disconnected,
there is sufficient residual electrical charge to give you a shock (even to kill you).

#### Evacuation

If the fire is already too big to fight with the resources available, evacuate the building. Turn off power at the mains. Close all reachable
doors and windows. Try to contain the fire while evacuation is completed and to prevent the fire&rsquo;s spread before fire-fighting services or
rescuers arrive.

Fire travels upwards faster than downwards &ndash; though a collapsing floor or wall will carry the flames to a lower level. Staircases,
lift-wells and ventilation shafts are particularly dangerous.

NEVER use a lift during a fire. If you need to move down a building, use a smoke-free staircase.

Before opening any doors look for smoke around their edges and check for heat. Metal doorknobs are a good test. If they feel warm do NOT open the
door &ndash; use the back of your hand for the test. Grasping the knob could cause a burn. A stout door can keep back flames for 30 minutes or
more (but do not rely on this with thin-panelled modern doors &ndash; unless they are fire doors).

<figure className="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image005.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*When a fire is too large to battle with available resources, call for assistance and leave the building immediately. If fiery passageways
blocked with flames and toxic gases block your escape, find the safest room available and stay there until help arrives. Only jump out of a
tall building as a final resort.*</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Waiting for rescue

If you find yourself isolated and unable to get to safety, go to a room as far from the fire as possible (but NOT on a higher level unless you are
certain that rescuers with long ladders or other equipment are very close). If there is a choice, pick a room with the softest ground outside, no
railings below or where there are bedclothes or curtains which you can knot into a rope. Lawns, flowerbeds, even gravel paths are softer than
cobbles, concrete or paving. If you are eventually forced to drop down on to hard concrete a sloping surface will be likely to do you less damage.

Close the door and fill any gaps around it with curtains, mats or other thick material, which will take time to catch alight. Wet them if you can.
If the alarm has not already been given try to attract attention through the window.

To break the window, use a piece of furniture. You could kick it out, but do not bring your foot back quickly &ndash; you will have to negotiate
broken glass. If you have to use your hand, wrap it first and punch. Alternatively, when protected by a thick jacket, an elbow may be effective.

:::tip[SURVIVAL ADVICE]
If there is no alternative to going into a burning room: brace your foot against the door and open it only a crack &ndash; this will help
to stop it being forced wide open by the pressure of hot air and gases inside. Crouch low to enter, opening the door as little as
possible. This will expose you to less smoke and heat and give less chance for the fire to pass through the gap. Close the door behind you
to delay the fire&rsquo;s spread.
:::

#### Preparing to &lsquo;jump&rsquo;

If no rescue is forthcoming do NOT jump &ndash; drop. Tie sheets, blankets, mats, loose covers and other strong material together to make a rope
&ndash; even if it does not reach the ground it will reduce the distance you will have to fall. Tie them with reef knots and test that each is
firm by pulling. Push a heavy piece of furniture over to the window and secure one end of your rope to it, or tie your rope to heating pipes
&ndash; or smash the window and tie on to a thick part of the frame. If the rope is not long enough drop cushions, pillows, a mattress &ndash;
anything which will soften your landing, below the window.

If there is nothing to use as a rope, lower yourself out of the window and hang from the sill. If there is no sill hang from the bottom of the
window frame.

#### Dropping from a height

Having taken every recommended measure to reduce the height of your fall, think of protecting your head &ndash; a motor-cycle crash helmet is
ideal but a jersey or towel wrapped round your head like a turban will help.

When you are as low as possible, and ready to drop, push yourself away from the building with the side of one foot and, as you let go, turn away
from the wall and bend the knees. Leave the arms up to protect the sides of the head.

As you land bend the knees more and roll over on to one side, carrying the roll on to your back (still protecting your head and with your legs in
the air). This helps spread the impact over a larger area and increases your chances.

#### Falling onto a slope

Face down the slope as you drop, with legs together, with the knees slightly bent. Bring the head down on to the chest and the elbows tightly into
the sides, the hands protecting the head. Land on flat feet, allowing the knees to bend fully, rolling forward in a tight somersault. It is the
method that parachutists use.

Wait until the very last chance of rescue before risking a drop greater than 4m (13ft).

:::tip[SURVIVAL ADVICE]

-   Do NOT jump out &ndash; unless there is a party of firefighters waiting to catch you in a blanket. Where there is something to break
    your fall make use of it, do not try to drop clear. A car roof makes a good cushion to drop on for it will give slightly to your
    weight.
-   BEWARE: Trees may break your fall, but there is a risk of your being impaled on the branches.

:::

:::tip[ESCAPING THROUGH FIRE]

-   If forced to travel through flames to reach safety, cover yourself (including your head) in a blanket, curtain or overcoat &ndash; wet
    it if you can &ndash; then take a deep breath and go.
-   If your clothes catch alight do NOT stay on your feet when out of the fire. The flames and smoke will travel up your body, over your
    face and into your lungs.
-   Do NOT run &ndash; this will only fan the flames.
-   Roll on the ground and try to wrap yourself in something that will smother the flames &ndash; a mat, blanket or overcoat.
-   If someone else comes running out of a fire with their clothes alight, push them to the ground and use the same methods of denying the
    flames oxygen. Do NOT hug them to you or your clothes may catch fire.

:::

### VEHICLE FIRES

The greatest danger with cars is the risk of the fuel tank being ignited &ndash; it could explode like a bomb, scattering burning petroleum
everywhere. The aim is to control the fire before it can reach the tank. Everything has a flash point and a fuel tank is more at risk than most
things. Usually a fuel line (if not armoured) will catch fire first, acting as a fuse which eventually ignites the tank.

#### In a garage

If a car catches fire in a confined space, such as a garage, smoke and toxic fumes will soon build up. Try to put the fire out first &ndash; but
if that is not practicable remove the car from the building, before it further endangers life and property.

Do NOT get into the car. You can do everything from outside including steering. If possible, push or pull the car out. If your car has a button
starter, select a low gear or reverse and use the starter to bounce the car out. With conventional ignition, turn the key in short bursts. BE
PREPARED. The car will jerk forward violently.

#### Fire extinguisher

SQUEEZE &ndash; or press the handle/trigger

SWEEP &ndash; from side to side

Check to see what kind of extinguisher you have. Some are designed for small, simple fires and contain water &ndash; they are NOT suitable
for oil or electrical fires. Others are designed for oil, grease, paint or solvent fires (a chip pan or petrol spillage, for instance). A
third type is for electrical fires or those where live cables are exposed. A multi-purpose dry-chemical type extinguisher can be used on
most kinds of fire.

KNOW HOW TO USE YOUR EXTINGUISHER!
:::

-   **In a crashed car**: doors may jam. If it catches fire get through any window or kick the windscreen out.

-   **If the fire is inside the car**: use the extinguisher or smother it with a rug or coat. Synthetic materials used in
    upholstery in many cars burn rapidly and give off thick smoke and toxic gases. These will persist even when the flames are out so get out into
    the air as soon as possible.

-   **If the fire is also on the outside**: amid spilt fuel, for example, keep the windows shut and drive out of the
    danger zone, abandoning the car as soon as it is safe to do so.

:::tip[FIRES IN THE AIR]

Aeroplanes are equipped with automatic extinguishers for engine fires and hand-held extinguishers in the cabin. Action should be taken
immediately. On civil airlines summon a cabin crew member immediately you suspect fire &ndash; they know where equipment is and how to use
it. Avoid creating panic in other passengers. If you see smouldering or flames, smother with an airline blanket or clothing.

The main fire dangers are: before take-off when there is volatile fuel and vapour around the plane and especially when landing under
difficult circumstances when fuel tanks could be ruptured and electrical or friction sparks ignite aviation spirit. Every safety
precaution is taken to ensure that fire is not a hazard.

:::

## **Chemical and biological warfare**

**Terrorism is not new. The destruction of property, murder, threats, fear and panic have long been the tools of those who believe that violence is
a means of achieving political and criminal goals. What makes modern terrorists distinct from their historical predecessors is the technology at
their disposal and the greater range of opportunities for terrorism which modern life provides.**

The global nature of media coverage and the publicity it can give has also fuelled the use of terrorism. There is no doubt, also, that some
nations finance and support the activities of terrorists in other countries with which they have political difference.

More value is now placed on the lives of ordinary people, the more innocent the victim, the better for terrorism. The reality is that we are ALL
potential targets and that we are ALL vulnerable.

Certain countries of the world pose a real threat by producing vast amounts of lethal bacteria and chemicals. These are relatively easy to
disperse and threaten large areas of the globe.

Biological agents fall into two groups, pathogens (germs) and toxins. Pathogens are living micro-organisms that cause lethal incapacitating
diseases like anthrax. Toxins are poisons that are lethal to humans, affecting the nervous system, and causing cell death.

Germs must be inhaled, enter through a break in the skin, or through the digestive tract. They do not react immediately as they must multiply
inside the body and overcome the body&rsquo;s defences. This incubation period varies from hours to months depending on the germ. Biological
agents are hard to detect, none of our physical senses can detect them. Often the first signs are symptoms of the victims exposed to the agent,
and sick-looking plants and animals.

### Toxins

Toxins occur naturally in plants and animals, but can be manufactured and used as weapons which are a thousand times more lethal. Toxins produce a
similar effect to chemicals but do not respond to the same treatment. Unlike germs they can penetrate unbroken skin, and their symptoms appear
immediately. These include: headache, nausea, blurred vision, increased salivation, paralysis, convulsions, fever, blisters/rashes, shock and
death.

#### Protection

If you suspect the presence of biological agents, put something around the mouth and nose to prevent inhalation. It is unlikely that you have a
mask so improvise by wrapping a cloth made from a tight weave around the face. Cover all exposed parts and leave the area as soon as possible.
Button/zip-up all clothing. Tuck trousers into socks, and wear gloves. When out of the danger area, wash thoroughly with soap and water. Clean
teeth, hair and fingernails. Wash all clothing and equipment in hot soapy water.

### Anthrax

Anthrax is a disease carried by animals and still kills many humans annually. The disease is transmitted from dead animals in areas like South
America, Southern Europe and the Middle and Far East. Signs on the dead carcass include incomplete rigor mortis, dark-coloured blood oozing from
nostrils and anus. Avoid all contact and wash thoroughly if accidental contact is made. Seek professional advice soonest. Antibiotics will help,
and there is a serum available for the treatment of anthrax.

The early signs of the disease are pustules with dark centres. Anthrax is also produced as a biological weapon.

### Chemicals

Chemical agents take the form of liquids, gas, powders and aerosols. They may affect breathing, the nervous system or the blood. Chemical agents
are difficult to detect so watch for suspicious signs in your companions. Difficulty in breathing, coughing, itching and tears are the most
obvious ones. The landscape will look wasted, with vegetation being discoloured and limp (although this happens after people are affected), and
there may be dead animals and insects scattered around. Some agents are odourless and others have a distinctive smell. The smell of bitter almonds
(cyanide) may indicate a blood agent, and newly cut grass might indicate a choking agent (phosgene).

#### Protection

The whole body must be covered with suitable clothing that will prevent the chemicals penetrating. Waterproof outer garments, goggles and mask are
essential. Get out of the danger area and decontaminate as soon as possible, the same as with pathogens. (Cat litter can help to mop up any liquid
contamination.)

<figure className="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image008.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*Protective clothing is a must in any chemical or biological disaster.*</figcaption>
</figure>

## **Gases and chemicals**

**Explosive gases can occur and build up in caves and mines, but the main dangers to the survivor in the wild will be oxygen deficiency and carbon
monoxide poisoning in restricted spaces and shelters.**

**In house and vehicle fires and in industrial locations there is risk from toxic fumes being produced when plastic and other materials burn.
Industrial and road accidents involving chemicals present another danger.**

There is little that can be done to protect yourself in a disaster such as that at Bhopal, in India, once they have happened, other than stay
indoors and keep your doors and windows closed. But you can try to discover any risks that are likely from industrial or other plant in your area.
There should be government and local authority checks and controls operating to enforce proper safety procedures.

Many authorities demand labelling of places where chemicals are used or stored &ndash; in London, for instance, by a yellow triangle and/or the
sign HAZCHEM.

If handling dangerous materials &ndash; not just at work, potentially dangerous substances are used in domestic chores, gardening and hobby
pursuits &ndash; follow recommended safety procedures. AVOID contact with chemicals and inhalation of fumes and take precautions against spillage,
shaking, breakage or accidental mixture with other chemicals which could produce a dangerous reaction.

If exposed to fumes or chemical hazard get to fresh air as rapidly as possible and flush away chemicals with copious quantities of water &ndash;
BUT adding water to some chemicals can cause even more dangerous reactions. Learn the properties of materials you handle or transport and measures
for dealing with accidents.

AVOID touching anyone contaminated with chemicals and do NOT give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until you know what chemicals are involved.

<figure className="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image009.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*It is very dangerous to approach a tanker or lorry on fire as the fuel tank could explode. The cargo can also pose a significant risk if it
catches fire, depending on what it is.*</figcaption>
</figure>

### ROAD AND RAIL

Keep well clear of an accident involving a bulk tanker or other vehicle carrying dangerous substances. You may be able to see spillages on the
road surface. Gas escapes may NOT be visible.

Chemical fires may be fought by appropriate techniques. If not properly trained and equipped to handle them you may aggravate the situation,
endangering yourself and others.

The usual action in such cases will be to cover any flammable substances with foam to exclude oxygen, and to dilute chemicals that do not react
dangerously to water with as much water as possible.

There are too many cases on record of public-spirited individuals losing their own lives in such circumstances &ndash; like the man who went to
aid the driver of an overturned tanker which had been carrying powerful acid. By the time the fire service arrived his gold wedding ring was all
that remained of him.Vehicles may be painted with a panel warning that they carry potentially dangerous chemicals which includes a code of figures
and letters which tell the emergency services what kind of action to take, what kind of protection is essential and whether the chemical is
explosive or poisonous. In the British code, for instance, a final E is an instruction to EVACUATE. The figures 1 or 2 at the beginning of the
code suggest that water may be used, but that is only part of the information needed &ndash; the use of water could produce fumes which demand use
of a respirator. Protective clothing may be essential.

Details of these codes are not usually given to the general public, for the information that they provide does not give practical guidance to the
untrained, beyond a warning that dangerous materials are carried.

Although the information provided by the codes is valuable to the officers of the emergency services, they do not know the proportions in which
spilt chemicals are concentrated, or whether combinations of chemicals could produce results quite unlike those expected. Where dangerous stores
and goods in transit are registered with the authorities rescue services may be able to obtain additional information, but uncontrollable elements
such as wind direction, temperature and various other factors will all affect the way in which such accidents are handled.

If you see a British hazardous chemical code, an EC Accord Europ&eacute;en Relatif au Transport International des Marchandises Dangereuses par
Route (ADR) sign, which gives much less detailed information, or the United Nations International Emergency Action Code (EAC), which only covers a
limited number of emergency procedures, KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

:::tip[SURVIVAL ADVICE]

BUT if you do not know what exact substances are involved and the appropriate action &ndash; KEEP CLEAR. CALL THE FIRE SERVICE OR POLICE
AND LEAVE ALONE.
:::

## **Flood**

**Flooding may be caused by the overflowing of rivers, lakes and reservoirs caused by heavy rains (not necessarily rainfall at the place where the
flood occurs); by the build-up of sea or lake water due to the effects of submarine earthquake, hurricanes and freak high-tides and winds; or by
the collapse of dams or dykes.**

Heavy rain can rapidly produce torrents where there was a dry riverbed, or a build-up in a narrow channel or behind a barrier which then gives way
to a rushing wall of water that envelopes everything in its path.

Persistent rainfall over a long period after a dry spell and heavy storms should alert you to keep clear of water channels and low-lying ground,
but a flood can affect much wider areas. It is always safer to camp on a spur. If the water is rising, move to higher ground. In hilly areas keep
out of valley bottoms which are particularly prone to flash floods.

Food is not likely to be a problem, at least at first, for animals will also head for high ground. Both predators and prey are likely to
concentrate on getting to safety &ndash; but beware of injury from panic-stricken animals in the water.

Drinking water may be difficult to obtain, for the water swirling around you may be contaminated. Collect rainwater to drink and boil any other
water before you use it.

#### Flooded buildings

If you are in a solid building when the water begins to rise, stay where you are if it is rising rapidly. You will be less at risk than trying to
evacuate on foot. Turn off gas and electricity and prepare emergency food supplies, warm clothing, drinking water in screw-topped plastic bottles
or other well-sealed containers. It is important to keep all water containers sealed to avoid accidental spillage or contamination. If you can,
collect a torch, whistle, mirror, brightly coloured cloths, or flags, which would be useful for signalling, and add them to your gear. A camp
stove will be valuable for heating food and drinks and for warmth. Candles are also useful &ndash; and DON&rsquo;T forget the matches.

<figure className="figure">
  <BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image010.webp" />
  <figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*In a flood, never attempt to drive your car on submerged roadways. Strong currents could sweep your vehicle away, trapping you amid rapidly
rising floodwaters.*</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Move upwards

Move to an upper floor, or on to the roof if in a single-storey building. If you are forced to occupy the roof, erect some kind of shelter. If it
is a sloping roof, tie everyone to a chimneystack or other solid structure which can be expected to stay firm. If the water looks like continuing
to rise, prepare some kind of raft. If you have no ropes to tie things together, use bed sheets. Unless the water threatens to wash your building
away, or rises so high that you are forced to evacuate, stay until it stops rising.

#### Flood readiness

If you live in a river valley or in a coastal area prone to flooding, find out how high you are above normal water levels. Learn the easiest route
to high ground &ndash; not necessarily the highway route, for major roads tend to follow drainage channels in valley bottoms. In rainy periods
listen out for flood warnings which will often predict the levels to which waters may be expected to rise and the areas likely to be affected.

Even a few inches of floodwater can do a lot of damage and it is worth laying sandbags or plastic shopping bags filled with earth along the bottom
of doorways and windows to keep out as much water as possible. If you have a really sound building and doorways, windows and other apertures are
blocked, water will not enter. The central heating flue, ventilation bricks and other spaces must all be sealed.

If a high flood is likely, there is not much point trying to keep water out of basements. Indeed, in some houses with basements this could cause
extra damage due to uneven pressure on the basement walls. If you are bound to be flooded, you could consider flooding the basement yourself with
clean water, so that the pressure is equalized. You will have less filth and debris to clear up later.

#### Evacuation

If you are abandoning your home bring outdoor furniture and other movables indoors &ndash; that will reduce the amount of debris floating or being
swept along outside.

When walking or driving to a safer location: Remember that a small drop in the level of the roadway down a hill can make a considerable difference
to the water depth.

Do NOT attempt to cross a pool (or a stream) unless you are CERTAIN that the water will not be higher than the centre of the car&rsquo;s wheels or
higher than your knees.

If you must cross: use river-crossing techniques (see
_<a href="Papertrell://navigatetocomponent/e99924f2-747d-4b0d-b272-cafede422225?selector=01308">On the Move</a>)._

If crossing bridges which are underwater: take special care &ndash; you may not be able to see that the flood has already swept part of the bridge
away.

#### Flash floods

In times of sudden heavy rainfall keep out of valley bottoms and stream beds both during and after rainfall. Remember that you don&rsquo;t have to
be at the bottom of a hill to be caught by water rushing down it &ndash; often carrying mud and a deadly debris of broken trees and rocks.

#### Coastal flooding

Is usually a combination of high tides and winds which make them even higher. Flood warnings will usually be given and evacuation is the best
action.

#### Flood aftermath

As the waters recede they leave a scene of devastation littered with debris and the bodies of flood victims. With decay and the pollution of the
water comes the risk of disease and extra precautions are necessary. Burn all animal corpses &ndash; do not risk eating them &ndash; boil all
water before using. Some crops may still be available after the floodwaters recede and birds that have escaped the flood will be safe and good to
eat.

:::tip[SURVIVAL SCENARIO]

What can you do to prepare for disaster?

Make sure that you are aware of what the dangers are. This may depend upon where you are travelling or what time of year you will be
there. You should be aware of what contingencies are in place in case of, say, earthquake or flood. Ask the locals for advice.
:::

### TSUNAMI

A tsunami is linked with an earthquake beneath the ocean, creating a series of waves which can reach more than 30m (98ft) high and causing a
considerable amount of damage along coasts.

Warnings of tsunami are issued from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&rsquo;s Pacific Tsunami Warning System headquarters in
Hawaii.

Not all earthquakes cause tsunami, but any earthquake could. Keep away from shores and take to higher ground when there are tremors. Do NOT go to
look for a tsunami &ndash; if you are close enough to see the wave, you are too close to escape it, unless high above its level. There is little
defence against a moving wall of water. Evacuate.

<figure className="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image011.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*If you are trapped in a building when flooding begins, move to the highest floors of the structure. If the water level continues to rise you

event that the water carries you off the roof.*</figcaption>
</figure>

## **Hurricane**

**A hurricane is a wind of high speed &ndash; above force 12 on the Beaufort Scale &ndash; which brings torrential rain and can destroy any flimsy
structures. It is a tropical form of cyclone, which in more temperate latitudes would be prevented from developing in the upper levels of the air
by the prevailing westerly winds.**

Hurricanes are known by various names around the world:

**Hurricane**: Caribbean and North Atlantic, eastern North Pacific, western South Pacific.

**Cyclone**: Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, southern Indian Ocean.

**Typhoon**: China Sea, western North Pacific.

**Willy-willy**: north-west Australia.

Hurricanes develop over the ocean when sea temperatures are at their highest, especially in late summer. Warm air creates a low pressure core
around which winds may rotate at speeds up to 300kph (186mph) or more, circling anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, clockwise in the
southern.

The strongest winds are usually 16-19km (10-12 miles) from the centre of the hurricane but the centre, or &lsquo;eye&rsquo;, brings temporary
calm. The &lsquo;eye&rsquo; may be from 6&ndash;50km (4&ndash;30 miles) across and the largest hurricanes up to 500km (300 miles) in diameter.
They can occur at any time of year but, in the northern hemisphere, the main season is June to November &ndash; in the southern, November to April
(especially January and February). Hurricanes are not a feature of the South Atlantic.

#### Pattern of the hurricane

Out at sea hurricanes will build up force and begin to veer towards the pole, the wind speed usually being greatest on the poleward side of the
eye. They can travel as fast as 50kph (30mph) wreaking devastation on islands and along shorelines they pass over, but usually slowing down when
they reach the mainland to a speed of about 16kph (10mph).

<figure className="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image012.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*Hurricane Katrina was the costliest hurricane in US history, with estimates on the cost of the damage topping $40bn. When the levee system
failed, New Orleans was catastrophically flooded, leaving 80% of the city under water.*</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Hurricane warnings

Satellite surveillance enables meteorologists to see hurricanes developing far out in the ocean, to track their progress and to give warning of
their approach. Some hurricanes move very erratically, so sailors particularly, should monitor forecasts in hurricane areas.

Without radio to alert you, the growth of swell can be an indication of a hurricane &ndash; when coupled with other conditions such as highly
coloured sunsets or sunrises; dense banners of cirrus cloud converging towards the vortex of the approaching storm; abnormal rises in barometric
pressure followed by an equally rapid drop.

If you are in a solid building and on high ground STAY WHERE YOU ARE &ndash; travel in a hurricane is extremely dangerous. The safest place is
usually in a cellar or under the stairs. Store drinking water &ndash; water and power supplies may be cut off by the storm &ndash; and have a
battery-operated radio to keep in touch with any instructions issued. If not in a sturdy structure, evacuate to a hurricane shelter. Shut off
power supplies before you leave.

#### Seeking shelter

Outdoors a cave will offer the best protection. A ditch will be next best. If unable to escape lie flat on the ground where you will be less of a
target for flying debris. Crawl to the lee side of any really solid shelter such as a stable rocky outcrop or a wide belt of large trees. Beware
of small trees and fences which could be uprooted.

:::tip[SAFETY PRECAUTIONS]

Get out of the hurricane&rsquo;s path if you can.

-   Hurricane warnings are usually issued when one is expected within 24 hours and will give you plenty of time to evacuate its path, if
    you are prepared.
-   Keep away from the coast, where destruction will be worst, with flooding and a tidal wave, and from river banks.
-   Board up windows and secure any objects outdoors that might be blown away.
-   At sea take down all canvas, batten down the hatches and stow all gear.

<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*Hurricanes can reach wind speeds of over 250kph (156mph), causing immense property damage and loss of human life.*</figcaption>
</figure>

:::tip[SURVIVAL ADVICE]

Stay where you are when the hurricane appears to have passed &ndash; there will usually be less than an hour of calm as the eye passes and
then the winds will resume in the opposite direction. If sheltering outdoors move to the other side of your windbreak in preparation or
move to better shelter if close by.
:::

## **Tornado**

**Tornadoes are violent storms associated with low atmospheric pressure and whirling winds. They apparently develop when air at the surface has been
warmed and a column of air descends from the base of cumulonimbus storm clouds above. Air rushing into the low pressure area begins to rotate
fiercely.**

Tornadoes are the most violent of atmospheric phenomena and the most destructive over a small area. Wind speeds have been estimated at 620kph
(385mph).

The diameter of the &lsquo;twister&rsquo; at ground level is usually only 25&ndash;50m (80&ndash;160ft) but, within it, the destruction is
enormous. Everything in its path except the most solid structures is sucked up into the air. The difference in pressure outside and inside a
building is often the cause of collapse &ndash; or &lsquo;explosion&rsquo;. Tornadoes can sound like a spinning top or engine and have been heard
up to 40km (25 miles) away. They travel at 50&ndash;65kph (30&ndash;40mph).

At sea tornadoes produce waterspouts. Although they can occur elsewhere, tornadoes are most prevalent over the prairies of the United States, in
the Mississippi-Missouri valley and in Australia. They can develop in a hurricane.

<figure className="figure">

<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*Among the most violent of the earth&rsquo;s natural phenomena, tornado wind speeds have been estimated at 620kph (385mph). Nearly everything
unlucky enough to be in the path of a &lsquo;twister&rsquo; is ripped off the ground and battered into heaps of splintered wreckage.*</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Tornado precautions

Take shelter in the most solid structure available &ndash; reinforced concrete or steel-framed if possible, but preferably in a storm cellar or
cave. In a cellar stay close to an outside wall, or in a specially reinforced section. If there is no basement, go to the centre of the lowest
floor, into a small room or shelter under sturdy furniture &ndash; but not where there is heavy furniture on the floor above. Keep well away from
windows.

Firmly close all doors and windows on the side facing the oncoming whirlwind and open those on the opposite side. This will prevent the wind
getting in and lifting the roof as it approaches and equalize the pressure to prevent the house &lsquo;exploding&rsquo;.

Do NOT stay in a caravan or car, they could be drawn up by the storm.

Outdoors you are vulnerable to flying debris and to being lifted up &ndash; though people have been lowered to the ground again unharmed! You CAN
see and hear a tornado coming. Get out of the way. Move at right angles to its apparent path. Take shelter in a ditch or depression in the ground,
lie flat and cover your head with your arms.

## **Lightning**

**The release of electrical charges built up in clouds can be especially dangerous on high ground or when you are the tallest object. In a lightning
storm keep away from hill brows, from tall trees and lone boulders. Make for low, level ground and lie flat.**

#### Insulation

If you cannot get away from tall objects, but have DRY material which will provide insulation, sit on it. Rubber-soled shoes may help insulation
but are not a guarantee that you will be safe. A dry coil of climbing rope makes good insulation. Do NOT sit on anything wet. Bend your head down
and hug your knees to your chest, lifting your feet off the ground and drawing in all your extremities. Do not reach down to the ground with your
hands, that could give a contact to conduct the lightning. If you have nothing which will insulate you from the ground lie as flat as you can.

#### Stay low

You can sometimes sense that a lightning strike is imminent by a tingling in the skin and the sensation of the hair standing on end. If you are
standing up, drop to the ground AT ONCE, going first to the knees with the hands touching the ground. If you should be struck, the charge may take
the easiest route to the earth through your arms &ndash; missing the torso and possibly saving you from heart failure or asphyxiation. QUICKLY LIE
FLAT.

Do not hold metal objects when there is lightning about and keep away from metal structures and fences. However, do not jettison equipment if you
will lose it altogether (when climbing, for instance). A dry axe with a wooden handle may spark at the tip, but is well insulated. Proximity to
large metal objects can be dangerous, even without contact, for the shockwave caused by the heated air &ndash; as the lightning passes &ndash; can
cause damage to the lungs.

<figure className="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image015.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*Although being struck by lightning is rare, bolts travel at close to 148,800km (93,000 miles) a second, so if you&rsquo;re outdoors in a storm
you must take precautions. Take shelter, or lie as flat on the ground as possible.*</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Shelter

One of the best places to shelter in a lightning storm is at least 1m (3ft) inside a deep cave with a minimum of 1m (3ft) space on either side of
you. Do NOT shelter in a cave mouth or under an overhang of rock in mountainous country. The lightning can spark across the gap. Small openings in
the rock are frequently the ends of fissures which are also drainage routes and automatic lightning channels.

## **Earthquake**

**Earthquakes are perhaps the most feared of all nature&rsquo;s violence &ndash; they come suddenly with little warning. Unlike other natural
hazards, such as flood and fire, little can be done to prepare for them. They range from minor vibrations in the earth, detectable only on
delicate measuring instruments, to great upheavals tearing whole mountains apart.**

Minor earth tremors can happen anywhere, but major quakes are confined to known earthquake belts where buildings could be planned to withstand
them or to cause little damage if they do collapse &ndash; like traditional buildings in Japan. Modern cities rarely take this into account.

With constant monitoring by seismologists, major earthquakes can be predicted and some evacuation may be possible. Animals become very alert,
tense and ready to run.

A detailed knowledge of local geology may indicate the weak points along major fissures but the tremors and the waves of movement through the
earth could extend to almost anywhere in an earthquake zone.

#### Causes

Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of tension built up in the Earth&rsquo;s crust, as deep as 700km (435 miles) below the surface
&ndash; but only a rupture in the upper tens of kilometres is likely to produce movement affecting the surface. The shock wave for the 1964
Alaskan earthquake, for instance, was at about 20&ndash;30km (12&ndash;19 miles) deep.

The earthquake belts lie along the edges of the semi-rigid plates that form the Earth&rsquo;s crust. The deepest quakes occur along the ocean
trenches, forming and destroying volcanic islands. The most violent tend to occur in areas where one plate is thrusting beneath another, as along
the west coast of North America, where the San Andreas Fault is a particularly vulnerable zone.

A succession of preliminary tremors, known as foreshocks, often followed by a seismically quiet period, usually precede a major quake, which they
can actually trigger. These initial tremors may not be noticeable.

<figure className="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image016.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*The 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China decimated scores of buildings and left nearly 70,000 dead in its wake.*</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Domestic earthquake precautions

Stay tuned to a local radio station for up-to-date reports and advice if you have warning of a possible earthquake. Turn off gas, electricity and
water if advised to do so. Remove large and heavy objects from high shelves, from which they might fall on you. Put bottles, glass, china and
other breakables in low cupboards. Shelves should have a lip or low barrier to stop things slipping off. Cupboard doors should have positive
fastening &ndash; not just magnetic catches. Secure or remove suspended objects, such as large light fittings and hanging flower bowls.

Have ready in case needed: fresh water and emergency food, a torch, first-aid materials and a fire extinguisher.

#### Indoors

If you are indoors when an earthquake strikes, stay there. Douse fires. Stay away from glass, including mirrors, and especially from large
windows.

-   An inside corner of the house, or a well-supported interior doorway are good places to shelter.
-   A lower floor or a cellar probably gives the best chance of survival. An upper floor could come crashing down with you on it. Make sure there
    are plenty of exits.
-   Get beneath a table or other piece of substantial furniture which will give both protection and an air space.
-   In a shop keep away from large displays of goods which could come crashing down.
-   In high-rise offices stay put. Never go into a lift. Staircases may attract panicking people. Get under a desk.

#### In a car

Stop as quickly and safely as you can &ndash; but stay in the car. It will offer some protection from falling objects. Crouch down below seat
level and you will be a further protected if anything falls on the car. When the tremors cease keep a watch for any obstructions and hazards:
broken cables, undermined roadways or bridges which could give way.

#### Outdoors

Outdoors lie flat on the ground. Do NOT try to run. You will be thrown about and could be swallowed in a fissure.

-   Keep away from tall buildings.
-   Do not go deliberately underground or into a tunnel where you could be trapped by blockage or collapse.
-   If you have managed to get to an open space do not move back into buildings for if minor tremors follow they could collapse any structure left
    unstable by the first quake.
-   On a hillside it is safer to get to the top. Slopes are liable to landslide and there would be little chance of survival for anyone caught in
    the thousands of tons of earth and rock that could move with terrifying speed. People have been known to survive by rolling into a tight ball
    on the ground.
-   Beaches &ndash; provided they are not below cliffs &ndash; are initially fairly safe but, since tidal waves often follow a quake you should
    move off the beach to high open ground as soon as the tremor has finished. Further tremors are unlikely to be as dangerous as a tsunami.

#### Aftermath precautions

Rupture of sewage systems, contamination of water and the hazards of the bodies trapped in the wreckage can all make the risk of disease as deadly
as the earthquake itself. Bury all corpses, animal and human.

-   Do NOT shelter in damaged buildings or ruins. Build a shelter from debris.
-   Take special care over sanitation and personal hygiene. Filter and boil all water.
-   Do not strike matches or lighters, or use electrical appliances, if there is any chance of a gas leak. Sparks ignite gas.
-   Check sewage services are intact before using lavatories.
-   Open cupboards carefully, objects may tumble out.
-   Be prepared for aftershocks.

:::tip[SAFETY PRECAUTIONS]
KEEP AWAY FROM ANYTHING THAT MIGHT FALL ON YOU: trees in the open air, for they may be uprooted; building in towns, for &ndash; even if
they are stable enough not to be demolished &ndash; pieces may come crashing down. Ideally evacuate to an open area but, if that is not
possible &ndash; and you may have little time &ndash; it is safer to stay indoors. In the street ruptured gas mains and power cables may
add to the hazards. People going in and out are the ones at most hazard from falling masonry on buildings.
:::

:::danger[BE CALM! THINK FAST!]
Speed is essential if an earthquake strikes. There is little time to organize others. Use force if necessary to get them to safety or pull
them to the ground.
:::

## **Volcano**

**Active volcanoes are found in the areas of the world which are also most prone to earthquakes &ndash; where there is most movement beneath the
surface. Long-dead volcanoes and evidence of ancient volcanic activity can be found elsewhere &ndash; such as Arthur&rsquo;s Seat in Edinburgh,
Scotland.**

A channel is formed when pressure forces molten rock (magma) to the surface through a fault. The channel is usually the main outlet for further
eruptions, though other vents may appear. A major eruption may blow the whole top off a mountain.

The molten rock, usually known as lava when it reaches the surface, may be of two kinds: granite lava, which is viscous and slow moving, and
basalt lava, which flows more rapidly at speeds of 8&ndash;16kph (5&ndash;10mph). Granite lava tends to block the vent of the volcano, eventually
cleared by an explosion due to the build-up of pressure beneath &ndash; showering lava and pieces of mountain around for considerable distances
and causing fires.

<figure className="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/SASSurvial_image017.webp" />
<figcaption className="figure-caption text--center">*Erupting volcanoes scatter debris for miles, spew rivers of boiling lava, and can produce clouds of ash which, in the most extreme cases,
affect global weather cycles.*</figcaption>
</figure>

### ERUPTION HAZARDS

#### Lava

Although it is possible to outwalk or outrun most basalt lava flows they continue relentlessly until they reach a valley bottom or eventually cool
off. They crush and bury anything in their path. Lava flows are probably the least hazard to life produced by an eruption, for the able-bodied can
get out of their way. Other dangers are NOT so easily avoided.

#### Missiles

Volcanic missiles, ranging from pebble-size fragments to great lumps of rock and &lsquo;bombs&rsquo; of hot lava, can be scattered over
considerable distances. A shower of volcanic ash can fall over a much greater area, some dust being carried to great heights, and these are
dispersed around the world affecting weather conditions.

If evacuating from close to the volcano, hard helmets of the kind worn by building workers, motorcyclists or horseriders will give some
protection. Over a wider area, where evacuation may not be necessary, protection should be worn against the effects of ash and any rain which
accompanies it.

#### Ash

Volcanic ash is not ash at all, but pulverized rock forced out in a cloud of steam and gases. Abrasive, irritant and heavy, its weight can cause
roofs to collapse. It smothers crops, blocks transport routes and watercourses and, combined with toxic gases, can cause lung damage to the very
young, old and those with respiratory problems. Only very close to an eruption are gases concentrated enough to poison healthy people. But, when
sulphur dioxide in the ash cloud is combined with rain, sulphuric acid (and sometimes others) are produced in concentrations which can burn skin,
eyes and mucous membranes. Wear goggles (ski-goggles or a snorkelling mask which seal around the eyes, NOT sunglasses). Use a damp cloth over
mouth and nose, or industrial dust masks if available. On reaching shelter remove clothing, thoroughly wash exposed skin and flush eyes with clean
water.

#### Gas balls

A ball of gas and dust may roll down the side of a volcano at a speed of more than 160kph (100mph). This phenomenon (called by scientists a
nu&eacute; ardente &ndash; glowing cloud) is red-hot and moves too fast to be outrun. Unless there is a strongly built underground shelter nearby,
the only chance of survival is to submerge under water and hold your breath for the half-minute or so it will take to pass.

#### Mudflows

The volcano may melt ice and snow and cause a glacial flood or &ndash; combined with earth &ndash; create a mudflow, known as a lahar. This can
move at up to 100kph (60mph) with devastating effect, as in Colombia in 1985. In a narrow valley a lahar can be as much as 30m (98ft) high. They
are a danger long after the major eruption is over and are a potential risk even when the volcano is dormant if it generates enough heat to
produce meltwater retained by ice barriers. Heavy rains may cause it to breach the ice.

:::danger[WARNING]

Volcanoes usually show increased activity before a major eruption with rumblings and escapes of steam and gases. Sulphurous smells from
local rivers, stinging acidic rain, loud rumblings or plumes of steam from the volcano are all warning signs. Evacuating by car remember:
ash may make roads slippery, even if it does not block them. Avoid valley routes which could become the path of a lahar.

## **Nuclear explosion**

**Although a nuclear strike is unlikely, many countries have nuclear capabilities and must be regarded as a threat.**

The immediate hazards of a nuclear explosion are blast, heat and radiation. The severity of their effects will depend upon the size and type of
weapon, distance or height of the explosion, weather conditions and terrain.

#### Blast

The detonation causes the initial shockwave. Even more powerful is the compression of the air produced by the rapid expansion of the fireball. The
wave of pressure travelling outwards from the point of detonation will collapse buildings, uproot trees and fill the air with flying debris, well
before the heat follows. Approximately half the total energy of the explosion is expended in this way.

When the blast wave has passed, air rushes back to fill the void causing further damage. At distances where the initial blast has only weakened
structures this vacuum effect will finish the job.

#### Heat

The thermal radiation (heat and light) that is produced by a nuclear explosion reaches temperatures hotter than the sun. Close to the point of
detonation all inflammable materials will be ignited &ndash; even vaporized. In the case of the Hiroshima bomb, exposed skin was burned at a
distance of 4km (2&frac12; miles). Today&rsquo;s weapons are MANY times more powerful than that bomb and their effects comparably more extensive.

#### Radioactivity

In addition to the thermal radiation, nuclear fission produces alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. Although radioactive fallout settles to
earth, with the appearance of white ash or dust, this is the residue of destroyed matter and not the radioactivity itself. That cannot be detected
by human senses. A Geiger counter is required to register its presence, indicated by a dial or a sound signal which becomes faster as the
radiation increases.

-   **Alpha particles**: have low penetrating capabilities and it is easy to shield them off. They cannot penetrate the
    skin but they do present serious problems if ingested or inhaled.
-   **Beta particles**: are only slightly penetrating and heavy clothing and boots will give full protection. On exposed
    skin they cause burns. If ingested they attack bone, the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gland and other organs.
-   **Gamma rays**: are highly penetrating. They travel much slower than alpha and beta rays, damaging all body cells.

#### Residual radiation

The initial radiation given off during the first minute of a nuclear explosion can kill &ndash; but it lasts only a short time. Once the blast has
passed, so has the initial radiation threat. However, exposure to residual radiation can be equally dangerous.

The amount of residual radiation depends on how the bomb was detonated. If it was high above the ground and the fireball did not touch the earth
little residual radiation is produced &ndash; what the strategists call a &lsquo;clean bomb&rsquo;. If exploded on or near the ground, a huge
quantity of soil and debris is sucked upwards to a great height and falls back to earth as radioactive dust. Heavier particles fall in the
vicinity of the explosion, but lighter ones may be carried by wind over a wide area &ndash; spreading the radioactivity.

Radiation does decay. However, while as much as 70 per cent of the particles following an explosion remain radioactive for only one day or less,
it takes others years for their radiation to decay.

#### Radiation shelters

In default of a deep bunker equipped with air, water and food supplies, in which to sit out a nuclear conflict and its aftermath, the best
protection is a deep trench with a roof covered by a metre or more of earth. If the detonation is sufficiently distant not to produce total
destruction, the trench and earth will protect from blast, heat and radiation.

Look for terrain that has natural shelter, such as ravines, gullies, ditches and rocky outcrops. If you do not have a trench shelter prepared,
start digging &ndash; FAST! As soon as the hole is big enough, get inside it to continue digging, to minimize exposure to radiation if you are
caught-out while still digging. Rig up a roof. Even if only of cloth, it will stop dust falling on you. Penetrating rays can still reach you so
try to get a metre of earth above you. Make sure that you will be able to get out again.

If caught in the open get to your shelter as quickly as possible. Once under cover, remove outer garments and bury them under a foot of soil at
one end of the bottom of the shelter. Do not venture out until absolutely necessary and do not re-use your discarded garments. Under no
circumstances move out of the shelter in the first 48 hours.

If desperate for water a brief venture out, lasting not more than 30 minutes, is permissible on the third day. On the seventh day a further
exposure, of up to half an hour, can be extended on the eighth up to one hour and then from two to four hours for the next four days and from the
thirteenth day normal working hours, followed by rest in the shelter.

#### Decontamination

If your body, or even your clothing, has been exposed to radiation, it must be decontaminated. Once in shelter scrape earth from the shelter
bottom and rub it over the exposed parts of your body and your outer clothing. Brush it off and throw the soil outside. Wipe the skin with a clean
cloth if possible. More effectively, if water is available, wash the body thoroughly with soap and water instead of soil. Cat litter can help to
mop up any liquid contamination.

#### Medical care

ALL wounds must be covered to prevent alpha and beta particles entering through them. Burns, whether caused by beta particles and gamma rays or by
firestorm heat, should be washed with clean water and covered. Urine may be used, if no uncontaminated water is available. The eyes should be
covered to prevent further particles entering and a damp cloth placed over the mouth and nose to prevent further inhalation.

Radiation affects the blood and increases susceptibility to infection. Take all precautions &ndash; even against colds and respiratory infections.

### AFTERMATH

Unless stored in deep shelters, or with special protection, all foodstuffs are likely to have absorbed some measure of radioactivity. Be cautious
of foods containing a high salt content, dairy products, such as milk and cheese, and sea foods. After tests it was found that food with salt and
other additives had a higher concentration of radioactivity than food without them. Cured and processed meat are more readily contaminated than
fresh. Bone absorbs the highest levels of radioactivity, then lean meat, with fat lowest. Unless there are reasons not to do so, try to walk out
of the danger area after week two. Help will be on the way but may not enter the danger area, you may have to go to help. You should only have to
walk 10 miles or so, and so you should not need to eat anything, after all, you can do without food for three weeks. Vehicles will probably not
work due to Electromagnetic pulses. This will affect everything electrical. If it has a battery or a microchip, it will not work.

#### Water

Unless it is from a protected source, do not drink any water for at least 48 hours after detonation. Avoid water from lakes, pools, ponds and
other static surface water. Filter all water and boil it before drinking.

The following sources are the least contaminated (in order of least risk):

1. Underground wells and springs
2. Water in underground pipes/containers
3. Snow taken from deep below the surface
4. Fast-flowing rivers

Dig a hole by a fast-flowing stream and allow water to filter down into it. Scrape off any scum that forms on the surface and scoop up water.
Filter it through layers of sand and pebbles (dig deep to obtain these) in a can with holes punched in the bottom, or through a stocking. Boil in
an uncontaminated vessel.

Decontaminate utensils by washing thoroughly in fast-flowing or boiled water.

#### Animals as food

Animals that live underground have less exposure to radiation than those that live on the surface: rabbits, badgers, voles and similar animals are
the best bets but, when they venture out, they too will be contaminated. However, such food sources must be made use of. You will increase your
own contamination &ndash; but the alternative may be to starve.

To reduce contamination from meat do NOT directly handle carcasses; wear gloves or use cloth to cover the hands while carefully skinning and
washing. Avoid meat in direct contact with the bone. The skeleton retains 90 per cent of radiation so leave at least 3mm (1/8n) on the bone.
Muscle and fat are the safest part of the meat. Dismb-3 pb-0 alert ALL internal organs.

#### Plants as food

Root vegetables with edible tubers growing underground are safest &ndash; carrots, potatoes and turnips, for instance. Wash them well and peel
before cooking.

Smooth-skinned fruits and vegetables are next safest. Plants with crinkly foliage are the hardest to decontaminate, because of their rough
texture. They should be avoided.

#### Long-term survival

Predictions of the long-term results on the environment of major thermonuclear conflict differ widely. The possibility of a &lsquo;nuclear
winter&rsquo;, with consequent effect on climate and plant life far beyond strike areas, would make even subsistence agriculture difficult. In the
short-term, however, and in the case of limited conflict, the advice in Home Front will be relevant.

:::tip[SURVIVAL ADVICE]

Common symptoms of exposure to radioactivity are nausea, vomiting, general weakness. Ulcer-like sores appear on the skin, which tends to
take on a grey hue.
:::

:::tip[SURVIVAL ADVICE]

The radioactivity to which an unprotected person could be exposed in the first few hours will exceed that received during the rest of the
week. That in the first week will exceed that accumulated during the rest of a lifetime spent in the same contaminated area. It is
therefore important to be shielded during the initial stages.
:::

:::tip[SHIELDING]

Strictly speaking, it is impossible to shield completely from all radiation but a sufficient thickness of shelter material will reduce the
level of radiation to a negligible level. Below are some materials, and the thickness required to reduce radiation penetration by 50 per
cent.

## **Home front**

You do not have to be miles away from civilization to be caught in a survival situation. Natural disaster, civil disturbance or military action
could cut you off from all the usual services and food supplies. Until they can be re-established, you would be left to manage on your own
resources and skills.

With no power supplies, central heating, hot water, lighting, air-conditioning and refrigeration would all cease. Battery radios and television
would for a time give some news of the rest of the world, if the situation is not global, but post, telephone and newspapers would no longer be
available. A generator is an essential back up and a short-wave radio is useful. As mains water supplies ceased to function, so taps would run dry
and toilets would become unusable.

In the countryside there would be natural resources to draw upon. In large cities shops would soon be emptied of food &ndash; sold or looted
&ndash; and plants in parks and gardens would be rapidly stripped, once any private stocks had been exhausted. The population would have to make
forays out into the countryside to survive, or abandon the town, if not in a siege situation. Suburban dwellers have more vegetable plots and open
spaces to provide foodstuffs. They would be less dependent upon shops. Those away from major centres are more likely to have their own food
stocks, because they cannot shop at will.

Most families have some food in store. It should be rationed and supplemented with whatever can be found.

### FOOD STORES

Storing food is a good habit to get into, especially if you live in an isolated place, which can become completely cut-off. If you have a
year&rsquo;s food supply in store, and add to it as you use it, you will not only be able to survive the worst but will be able to live at last
year&rsquo;s prices.

The stock does not have to be established in one go. Build it up gradually, taking advantage of special offers in supermarkets. Buy an extra tin
or packet and put it by. Store your foods in a cool, dry, dark place and off the ground &ndash; moisture and heat cause bacteria and moulds. If
stores are left on the floor insects and rodents will help themselves. Make sure that all containers are insect- and rodent-proof.

Remember: Rotate cans, so that the contents do not settle, and separate. Label each can or packet with a
colour-fast waterproof pen, noting contents and date of storage. Use in sequence &ndash; the oldest first. Store methodically and if a label falls
off, you should still have a good idea of the contents.

Choice of foods will depend upon individual taste, but straightforward products (corned beef in preference to beef stew and dumplings) will keep
better and can be used in a greater variety of ways. Wheat keeps better than flour &ndash; it is less susceptible to moisture, light, insects and
temperature change. Wheat found in the pyramids was found in good condition after thousands of years. However, you must grind it to make flour, so
invest in a small hand grinder.

#### Keep it sealed

Screw-top sweet jars are ideal for storage and plastic containers with tight-fitting lids can also be used. Do not overfill them so that they
distort and the lid does not fit correctly. Use adhesive tape to seal the lids. Reseal after using some but remember that once opened, the
contents will begin to deteriorate.

#### Rations

Complete rations are available with various menus &ndash; either freeze-dried or dehydrated. They are lighter and less space-consuming than canned
foods. Freeze-dried are best for both taste and texture and retain minerals which are lost in dehydration. Although both need water for
reconstitution they can, in dire circumstances, be eaten as a dry munch.

#### Vitamins

Multi-vitamin tablets are also a good investment. The body can store up to a month&rsquo;s supply of most vitamins, then health will suffer if
they are not replaced. In stress situations they are more rapidly used up. The B family (and minerals, calcium and zinc) are the first to go.
Vitamin tablets do not have unlimited shelf-life &ndash; check manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions.

#### Other foods

-   Dried fruit and nuts are nutritious and should also be included &ndash; raisins, sultanas and currants all keep well. Nuts in their shells
    keep so long as they are dry. Packets of dried salted nuts such as peanuts, brazils and walnuts, are highly nutritious.
-   Potato powder is a great filler for hungry stomachs and can be prepared in several ways to make it palatable.
-   Brown rice has more nourishment than long-grain white rice which loses all its goodness when boiled.

#### Store location

The cooler the storage area, the better the stores will keep &ndash; a cellar is ideal but there may be a problem with dampness so keep all the
stores off the ground and inspect them regularly. If there is a skylight in the cellar, cover it. The store is best kept dark.

An attic is also convenient for storage &ndash; the stores are not in the way of day-to-day activities. However, it may get very warm in summer
and access may be difficult &ndash; especially if a ladder is the only means of entry &ndash; which may be awkward when trying to rotate bulky
stores. The roof is also a vulnerable position in most kinds of disaster situations. In an area where hurricanes can be expected an attic is not a
good choice. In territory liable to flooding a cellar would be equally at risk. Under the stairs is another area that may offer some protection,
though perhaps limited space.

Advantage should be taken of wherever is most conveniently available to store not only food but also medical supplies, disinfectants, cleansing
materials &ndash; and water. If you divide your stores into more than one area, each with a variety of items, you should be well prepared.

Filter and sterilize ALL water before using it for drinking. If circumstances make it impossible to boil water sterilize it with
chemicals.

-   FILTERING: Allow water to stand in its container so that sediment settles at the bottom. Then siphon it into a filter made up of a
    nylon stocking (or other porous material) stuffed with layers of sand (bottom), charcoal and moss (top).
-   STERILIZING: Clear water: add 2 drops household bleach per litre (1 per pint) or 3 drops 2 per cent tincture of iodine per litre (6

### PRIORITIES

In a domestic situation there is likely to be shelter, unless it has been totally destroyed, or the area has become a danger zone and evacuation
is imperative. Damage can be patched-up to provide some protection from the elements and more permanent repairs undertaken as soon as possible.

Water supplies are always likely to be a problem &ndash; for even during a flood drinking water is scarce. Fortunately there are likely to be some
immediate reserves on the premises and, with warning of a crisis, these can be supplemented.

Fire for warmth is less of a problem, since there will be burnable materials in the house and surroundings. Infection may prove the greatest
danger and strict hygiene and sanitary practices must be enforced.

### WATER

Although a family of four can use a considerable amount of water each week, only a small percentage of this is for drinking &ndash; a requirement
of about 2 litres (3&frac12;pt) per day per person. If warned of a crisis, fill as many receptacles as possible, especially in a hot climate. A
bath holds many gallons; increase its capacity by blocking the overflow. Use dustbins, buckets, pots &ndash; even strong polythene bags if they
are only half-filled and securely tied off.

Store water in the dark. If light gets to it green algae will develop. Water is bulky and heavy. Do not store it in the attic or it may bring the
ceiling down.

Even without advance warning there will be water in the storage tank, heating pipes, radiators, perhaps an aquarium, and the toilet cistern will
hold another few gallons &ndash; don&rsquo;t flush it. Outdoors you may have a swimming pool, water butts, or a pond &ndash; even water from a car
radiator can be utilized. Central heating water is usually treated with a de-oxygenizing agent and a car radiator probably contains anti-freeze,
so water from these places is best kept for cleaning purposes. If it has to be used for drinking boil it, collect the steam in clean cloths and
wring them out. Then reboil. (Also see
_<a href="Papertrell://navigatetocomponent/0447dd89-c84d-49b3-8cf0-e01451e9c56f?selector=00386">Essentials</a>.)_

Boiled water tastes flat and distilled water has even less taste. It is easy to restore some of its sparkle by putting oxygen back into it: simply
pour the water back and forth from one vessel to another. A small piece of wood charcoal placed in the vessel while it boils also helps taste.

#### Cooking in water

Water in which food is to be cooked MUST be boiled for at least eight minutes, but water not boiled for as long can be used for heating cans of
food provided it makes no contact with the foodstuff.

Stand the can in water, pierce a small hole in the top to avoid the risk of explosion and plug it with a twist of cloth so that water cannot enter
the can.

Alternatively, boil the water, remove it from the heat and place the unpierced can in the water. This takes longer for the can to heat through.

#### Water catchment

-   Catch all available rainwater. Break off lower sections of downpipes and divert the flow into a container such as a dustbin. Even if rainwater
    is pure, guttering may contaminate it &ndash; so sterilize.
-   Supplement water receptacles with tarpaulins or plastic sheets supported on sticks. Rinse between showers to reduce tainting.
-   Dig a hole and line it with a plastic sheet or concrete for water storage. Cover it to prevent evaporation and debris falling in.
-   If the local water table is high you may be able to dig down to water &ndash; there may even be a well on your property which could be
    reopened.
-   Solar and vegetation stills (see
    _<a href="Papertrell://navigatetocomponent/0447dd89-c84d-49b3-8cf0-e01451e9c56f?selector=00401">Essentials</a>_) are other ways of obtaining water.

#### Water conservation

Do not waste water washing clothes, other than underclothing. Never throw water away after use. Allow sediment to settle and it can be used again.

It is very important to wash the hands before preparing food, but the rest of the body can wait until it rains. The body produces natural oils
and, as long as the pores are kept open, health will not be affected. You soon get used to the smell, and social occasions are rare in a crisis
situation. If showers are few and far between, use a damp cloth for a strip wash &ndash; cloths left out on lawns or bushes overnight may gather
enough moisture for a wipe-down without using up your water stores.

Injured persons must receive priority for bathing and all their dressings should be boiled regularly.

### FIRE

The warmth and comfort of a fire are great morale boosters, but its most important use will be for boiling water and preserving food. These must
take priority in the use of fuel.

Blocked fireplaces should be opened up again and chimneys checked for obstructions. If they are not clear there is real risk of setting fire to
the chimneys themselves and thus to the house.

#### To clear a chimney

Tie a holly bush or a similar shrub to a long rope and from the rooftop lower the rope down the chimney (a stone tied on the end will ensure it
drops). Now pull down the holly bush and it will clear the chimney.

#### Improvised fireplaces

Where there are no fireplaces metal containers, metal dustbins lids and central heating radiators can all be used to light a fire on. In flats
with concrete floors a fire could be lit directly on the floor. If you have a barbecue stand make good use of it.

Never leave a fire indoors unattended. Even one in a proper grate should be allowed to die down for the night, if no one is going to stay up to
watch it.

#### Fuel

Start with garden furniture, trees, shrubs, bean sticks, swings, ladders, tool handles. When these run out start on furnishings. Carpets, curtains
and cushions will all burn. Cardboard, books and rolled- up newspapers will also give off a surprising amount of heat. All kinds of vehicle fuel
can also be burned as well as the conventional heating and lighting oils.

:::danger[WARNING]

Many modern fabrics and furnishings, especially PVC and foam-block furniture, produce poisonous gases when burned. If burning these items
make a fireplace in the garden or, if forced to burn them in a flat, make the fire near an open window. Cover the face with a damp cloth
when you need to go near the fire to tend to it and things being heated on it.
:::

:::tip[SURVIVAL TIP]

If food is short there will be none to spare for pets and you CANNOT afford to be squeamish. If the aquarium water has to be drunk
don&rsquo;t waste the fish. In fact they&rsquo;ll probably be the easiest to eat even if you don&rsquo;t need the water. The cat is next
in the pot. Once dressed it will be hard to distinguish from rabbit. Gerbils, hamsters, rabbits, budgerigars and parrots can all be added
to the diet and, unless the dog is an exceptionally good hunter, it should go too.
:::

### FOOD

-   Use the perishable foods first. Fatty foods are the first to deteriorate and canned foods the last.
-   Remember that, once electric power fails, the refrigerator and freezer cease to function &ndash; though they may take some time to defrost if
    you open their doors as seldom and briefly as possible.
-   Boil milk and it will keep longer.
-   Cook meat, wrap it in cloth and bury it in the earth. Cook pork first (which has the highest fat content), then lamb, then beef (which is the
    best meat to preserve).
-   Once meat has been cooked and allowed to cool, do NOT reheat it or you may risk food-poisoning.

#### Food from the garden

Vegetables with four petals, including all the brassicas, from wallflowers to cabbages are edible. Hollyhocks, though not very tasty, are
nutritious. Worms, slugs and snails are also edible. AVOID bulbs such as daffodils, tulips and aconites which are all poisonous.

#### Further afield

Explore parks and open spaces for other vegetation and for hunting and trapping wildlife. Birdlife in cities &ndash; especially pigeons and
starlings, will often fill the plate, especially if you bait snares and nets.

#### Closer to home

Beware of houseplants, some are poisonous, especially the diefenbachia and philodendron.

#### Preserving food

For methods of smoking, salting and making pickles and chutneys see
_<a href="Papertrell://navigatetocomponent/e99924f2-747d-4b0d-b272-cafede422225?selector=00464">Preserving Food</a>._

When the fridge no longer functions remove the motor, cut a hole in the bottom, place it on some stones or bricks and with a fire beneath use it
as a smoke-house.

### SHELTER

The first priorities will be a sound roof over your head and a stable structure. Clear any debris and ensure that there is nothing which could
still collapse or fall from above and cause injury. Use slates, tiles and bricks from other buildings to ensure that at least one building is
sound.

#### In cold weather

Conserve resources by living in one room, choosing a ground-floor room with a southern aspect (if you live in the northern hemisphere). Block all
draughts and avoid opening the door unnecessarily.

If there is a fire burning, make sure that there is adequate ventilation to avoid asphyxiation or carbon monoxide poisoning. Wear warm clothing to
help conserve fuel. The more people in the room, the higher the temperature. Rest and keep physical exertion to a minimum.

#### In very warm weather

Use upstairs accommodation and spread out. Open windows on the downstairs windward side and open all windows on the lee side upstairs. Leave all
the doors open and a cool breeze will blow through the house. It is best to rest during the day to conserve energy and fluids, and do any
necessary work at night.

#### Moving

If the house proves beyond repair, or other pressures force you to evacuate, take essential items &ndash; food, blankets, tools, medical supplies,
containers for water and materials suitable for shelter construction &ndash; if they are not likely to be available. Use a pram or a shopping
trolley as transportation. Either find an empty house or building, or prepare to set up camp in a location elsewhere.

### HYGIENE

Sanitation is very important during the aftermath of any disaster. Open sewers, contaminated water and the build-up of rubbish all help to cause
and spread disease. Germs carried by rats, fleas and other insects, rapidly multiply. All kinds of waste should be carefully disposed of and all
the procedures described (see
_<a href="Papertrell://navigatetocomponent/e99924f2-747d-4b0d-b272-cafede422225?selector=00619">Camp Hygiene</a>_) should be adapted to the doorstep situation.

#### Excreta

Urine is sterile but if large amounts accumulate they smell and attract flies. Use the &lsquo;desert rose&rsquo; urinal, of the kind described in
_<a href="Papertrell://navigatetocomponent/e99924f2-747d-4b0d-b272-cafede422225?selector=00000">Make Camp</a>_.
Keep the tube covered. If not used directly, pour all collected urine down the tube.

Build a latrine (again see _Make Camp), far enough from the house not to be smelt but near enough to be handy for_
&lsquo;emergencies&rsquo; &ndash; there will be many such emergencies in a survival situation. A box with a hole cut in the base can be used as a
thunder box. After use, if there is water available, wash yourself rather than using toilet paper. Wash the hands thoroughly afterwards.

Fit a lid to your thunder box, pile earth around the bottom and then you will contain the smells and keep out flies.

Move all muck with a shovel and avoid hand contact.

:::tip[FOOD DISEASES]

-   Salmonella and shigella are diseases transmitted through the oral-anal route, by contaminated hands.
-   Sores on hands can be a source of entry for staphylococcal food-poisoning with severe stomach pains, diarrhoea and dehydration.
-   Clostridium botulinum is a frequently fatal bacillus, which can be produced when canning at home if the temperatures are not high
    enough &ndash; it grows only when oxygen is excluded. There is no reliable way of determining whether food is contaminated so TAKE
    GREAT CARE if you do your own preserving. A related bacillus causes tetanus.
:::

:::tip[SOME USEFUL HERBAL PREPARATIONS]

-   Strawberry roots contain a descaler to clean teeth.
-   Delphinium seeds can be crushed to treat head lice.
-   Birch bark can be distilled to produce a tar oil which soothes skin complaints.

</figure>

#### Animals

Animals pick up diseases which can be transmitted to humans. If you handle animals, make sure you have no breaks in the skin &ndash; or wear
gloves. Infection can enter through the smallest of cuts. Cook all meat thoroughly.

#### Kitchen waste

All biodegradable waste should be stacked in a corner of the garden and composted to enrich the soil. Compost heaps are also a great source of
worms, which will add protein to your diet.

However, there should not be much kitchen waste. Do NOT peel potatoes, much of their food value is in the skin. The outer leaves of cabbages which
you once discarded will be edible if you cut them up small.

Non-biodegradable waste &ndash; cans and plastics that are not useful in some way &ndash; should be burned, flattened and buried. This stops them
attracting flies. In warm climates burn ALL waste. Put all the ashes in a pit.

#### Communicable diseases

Living in close-knit groups after a disaster increases the risk of passing on disease. Good personal hygiene &ndash; as good as possible &ndash;
can reduce the threat. Isolation of patients with colds or fever is advisable.

Seal dressings and discharges in a polythene bag and burn immediately. Dispose of all faeces and urine in the field latrine &ndash; and regularly
boil the container used for their disposal.

#### Personal hygiene

Wash with sand if there is no water available. Don&rsquo;t bite your nails &ndash; however stressful conditions may be &ndash; or put the fingers
to the mouth. Don&rsquo;t pick scabs or sores, and keep them covered. Change underclothes regularly and wash them (but don&rsquo;t use drinking
water to do so).

:::note[CASE STUDY: Cool, calm and collected]
The pilot of an aircraft that ditched in New York&rsquo;s Hudson River has been rightly hailed a hero after all 155 passengers and crew
were rescued. Captain Chesley Sullenberger showed every skill you need for survival.

The US Airways Airbus made the crash-landing minutes out of LaGuardia airport, both its engines apparently disabled by a flock of birds.
Ferryboats arrived within minutes of the crash to begin the rescue as passengers emerged in lifejackets and were rescued from the wings or
helped from the icy water by divers.

The temperature was almost &ndash;7&deg;C (20&deg;F) and the current in the Hudson was running rapidly.

The plane moved swiftly down river, threatening to submerge at one point, until guided to a halt by tugboats against a pier.

The captain walked the plane twice after everybody else was off to verify that there was nobody else onboard.

The pilot had textbook survival skills: he had air force training which teaches discipline and had experience as an air safety consultant.
He had also supplemented his skills by learning how to fly gliders.

In addition to the professional skills of his trade, the captain demonstrated two essential mental aspects of survival. He didn&rsquo;t
panic and he took complete charge of the situation.

LESSONS LEARNT:  
Leadership is vital. A strong leader is always in control of a situation. Also, learning to control fear and panic can save lives.
