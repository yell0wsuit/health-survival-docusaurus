Environmental changes may have increased the threat of natural disaster. The restlessness of the planet may manifest itself in many ways, from
floods to earthquakes—sometimes resulting in huge death tolls. Understand the dangers.

<div class="text-center">![](/images/img265_001.jpg)</div>

## **NATURAL DISASTERS**

Routine is the key to everyday living. It’s about getting up, remembering to take the dog for a walk, paying the electricity bill, going to
work, and coming home to switch on the news and watch what has been happening to other people. Yet every day, somewhere in the world, disaster
strikes, throwing normal life into chaos and reminding us that no matter how scientifically advanced our society, nature will always have the
upper hand.

All disasters, from earthquakes and volcanoes to hurricanes and tornadoes, from flooding to drought and severe winter storms, have the power to
devastate our safe urbanity, and force us to face the fragility of ordinary life. Suddenly, with no warning at all, you may have to cope with
disasters totally outside your experience. Emergency services are designed to step in on such occasions, but you may well have to rely on your own
instincts to survive—at least for the first few days.

By being prepared, you can reduce the fear, panic, inconvenience and loss that usually surround a disaster. Know the dangers and act accordingly.
Know how to protect yourself, feed yourself, and prevent needless injury until help arrives. But most of all, be a survivor!

:::info[DON’T PANIC]

No matter how severe or life-threatening the disaster, panicking will get you nowhere. It leads to muddled thinking and puts you at even
greater risk. Take a few deep breaths and calm yourself down, that way you’ll be able to make a more logical assessment of the dangers.

:::

### Morale

Never underestimate the psychological effects of losing a loved one, a home or treasured possessions. Everything you know and rely on may be swept
away from you. Disaster victims will be subject to an enormous amount of stress and may be terrified, irritable and exhausted. Try to boost morale
by concentrating on the positive aspects of being alive and the future. Survival is about THE WILL TO SURVIVE.

### Predicting disaster

Meteorological stations around the world use satellites, radar, observation boats and planes to study weather conditions 24 hours a day, and play
a major role in warning of predictable disasters such as flooding. Global communications mean that Britain’s Met Office will be informed of a
hurricane in Miami, as it’s happening. You can find out about foreign and local weather conditions by calling one of the telephone information
services such as Weathercall or Snowline.

:::info[SUPPLIES CHECK LIST]

-   Food—non-perishable, high protein, needing little or no cooking. Enough for at least three days
-   Special dietary requirements (diabetics etc) and baby food
-   Non-breakable eating/drinking utensils, water containers
-   Water-purifying tablets
-   Bottle/can openers
-   Camp stove with extra supplies of fuel. Do not stockpile liquid gas, it could be dangerous
-   Portable, battery-operated radio—make sure you know the frequency of your local station!
-   Flashlight
-   Extra batteries
-   Candles
-   Matches (in waterproof container)
-   Fire extinguisher/fire blanket
-   Adjustable wrench to turn off gas/water mains
-   Toilet paper
-   Disinfectant
-   Bucket with tight-fitting lid (as improvised toilet)
-   Plastic dustbin bags (to line the toilet)
-   First-aid supplies
-   Sanitary needs

:::

The Met Office is also responsible for faxing councils with local weather information, so that emergency and social services have time to go on
the alert. Every county council has an emergency planning officer responsible for coordinating services and voluntary organizations in the event
of a disaster. Contingency plans usually include a 24-hour phone line for those who need help. Know the emergency procedure for your area. Details
can be found in your library or consumer advice centre or can be obtained from your local council.

### Personal safety

Just as disaster brings out the best in some people, it can also bring out the worst. Society can break down in the most ordered of cities, and
looting and violence become as much of a threat as the disaster itself. In 1965 and 1977 New York suffered blackouts, where power and
communications throughout the city were suddenly inexplicably cut off. All hell broke loose (according to reports) with lootings, muggings and
arson occurring on a horrendous scale. Be aware of the dangers from other people who may try to take advantage of the situation. Always put life
before possessions.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

[THE SAS SURVIVAL HANDBOOK](/category/sas-survival-guide) deals with survival in the wild, while waiting for rescue. In a major disaster the survival priorities—food,
fire, shelter and water—will come to the fore. Be prepared!

:::

### Emergency supplies

An emergency supplies kit will be your lifeline. Store it in a cool, dark, dry place and make sure everyone in the home knows where it’s kept.
Keep a regular check on the state of supplies—DON’T wait until a disaster occurs before you find out your batteries are flat. Keep the
kit with a list of last-minute things you’re likely to need, such as contact lenses or specialist medical supplies—you might not be able
to think quickly enough at the time of emergency.

### Purifying water

The body can survive up to three weeks without food. Without water, death may occur between three and eleven days. If supplies are cut, domestic
cold water cisterns/tanks are a good source of water (you may need a flexible connecting hose), since they can hold as much as 180 litres (about
40 gallons). Do NOT use water in toilet cisterns for drinking.

If water is contaminated, strain through paper towels or clean cloth to remove any sediment. If a heat source is available, boil at a rolling boil
for at least five minutes. Alternatively, use water-purifying tablets. If neither is available and you are absolutely desperate, you can use
liquid household chlorine bleach (NEVER the granular form, which is poisonous) or two per cent tincture of iodine. Only purify enough water to
last a maximum of 48 hours—that-way you minimize the chance of recontamination.

:::danger[Warning]

If water is severely contaminated-possibly by sewage-or if there are chemical contaminants which may ‘cancel out’ the effects of
bleach or iodine, take great care. listen to warnings on the radio concerning drinking water. DON’T take chances!

:::

:::info[EMERGENCY-ONLY WATER PURIFICATION]

Add two drops of chlorine bleach to one litre (about two pints) of clear water. If the water is cloudy, double the ‘dose’ to four
drops. A plastic bucket for domestic use holds about nine litres (about two gallons) of water—increase the ‘dose’ to 16-18 drops
for clear water, 30 drops for cloudy.

If using tincture of iodine, use three drops for one litre (about two pints) of clear water and 24 drops for a bucketful. Double the
‘dose’ to six drops if the water is cloudy.

:::

## **EARTHQUAKE**

Major earthquakes can cause death and destruction on a massive scale. No other natural phenomenon is capable of such devastation over so large an
area in such a short space of time. In most cases the actual movement of the earth only lasts about 15 seconds (it may last several minutes), but
it is usually the after-effects which wreak the greatest havoc.

Buildings and bridges collapse, crushing people under the debris. Power and telephone lines are destroyed, causing fires which rage out of control
because of building failures and broken gas pipes. In the California earthquake of 1906, the resultant fire lasted four days before it burnt
itself out, leaving a path of destruction that left 300,000 homeless. In 1985, a massive earthquake in Mexico City reduced to rubble the homes of
100,000 people. As recently as 1988, a 6.5 magnitude earthquake in Armenia killed 25,000 people as well as making thousands more homeless.

Just as devastating, earthquakes can set off a chain of other natural disasters such as landslides, mudslides, avalanches, volcanic eruptions and
tsunamis—gigantic tidal waves reaching 30 metres (100 feet) high and travelling great distances, before crashing into coastal areas at
speeds of up to 645kph (400mph).

It’s a common misconception that earthquakes only occur along geological fault lines—recognizable ‘cracks’ in the rock structure
which indicate past movement. San Francisco is inextricably linked with violent earthquakes, built as it is on the San Andreas fault—a zone
of faulting and cracking that extends for hundreds of miles. Yet in the majority of earthquakes, fault rupture never even reaches the surface and
so is not directly visible.

### The Richter Scale

The definition of an earthquake is any abrupt disturbance within the earth’s structure resulting in the generation of elastic or seismic
waves. It is the passage of these seismic waves through the earth that usually causes the violent shaking at its surface, the earthquake. The
result can be anything from a slight tremor to a full-blown rupture, and is usually expressed on the Richter Scale (although other magnitude
scales are also used by earthquake observatories).

Based on seismograph recordings, the Richter Scale has no maximum or minimum levels—the biggest earthquakes so far measured have reached
magnitude 9. Each unit recorded represents a tenfold increase in terms of size, which makes an earthquake measuring 8 on the Richter Scale 10,000
times bigger than one of magnitude 4. An 8 would undoubtedly cause major devastation, whereas a 4 would probably result in only slight damage.

:::info[1976-THE EARTHQUAKE YEAR]

As many as 300,000 people are believed to have died in 1976 as a result of earthquakes, aside from the hundreds of thousands of casualties and
the enormous losses suffered.

February 4: Guatemala Approx 23,000 deaths

May 6: Italy 900 deaths

June 25: Irian Jaya 6000 deaths

July 28: China 250,000 deaths

August 16: Philippines 2000 deaths

November 24: Turkey 4000 deaths

:::

### Earthquake zones

The major earthquake zones or areas of seismic activity are most common around the edges of the Pacific Ocean—up the western coast of South
and North America and back down the western rim through Japan, the Philippines and the South Sea Islands—and, less actively, along the
Mediterranean Sea. But earthquakes can occur anywhere.

Even Britain suffers tremors—in 1984, Newton in central Wales experienced shaking houses, cracking walls and overturning furniture. In 1990
another tremor in the south of England shook pictures on walls. In the US, scientists estimate that 70 million people in 39 states could be
classed as high risk.

Despite scientific advances and seismological research in China, Japan, the US and the Soviet Union, no method has yet been devised to predict the
time, place or magnitude of earthquakes with a high degree of accuracy and consistency. Small tremors, also known as foreshocks, may be the only
advance warning, which is why earthquakes are so deadly. This means that year-round preparations, particularly for those in known unstable areas,
are an absolute necessity to plan for and survive a major earthquake.

### Getting prepared

Frightening though it is, the movement of the earth itself is seldom the direct cause of injury or death. The earth does not open up and swallow
cities whole! Earthquake injuries are usually caused through building collapse or structural damage and flying debris. If you live in a high-risk
zone, check for potential hazards and take immediate steps to make your home as safe as possible ([see SAFETY FIRST](/sas-urban/urban-safety-first)).

-   Check for cracks in your home’s walls and ceilings. Cracks wider than 3mm (1/8 in) could indicate potential weakness.
-   Heavy light fittings should be anchored solidly to joists above ceilings.
-   Defective electrical wiring, leaking gas and inflexible utility connections are potentially hazardous—have them checked out by
    specialists. Know where and how to shut them off at the mains in case of damage during the quake.
-   Water cisterns/tanks are a potential danger if they fall over or burst in an earthquake. What’s more, the water they contain could save
    your life if services are cut off. Make sure they are secure and in good repair.
-   Ensure shelves are safely fastened to walls. Place large or heavy items on lower shelves to reduce risk of injury. Put breakables in cupboards
    that can be fastened shut.
-   Children’s play areas should be away from brick or concrete walls which are not steel-reinforced and could collapse during earth tremors.
-   Ensure everyone in the home knows what to do in an emergency. Locate safe spots in each room—under sturdy tables or in strong interior
    doorways. Identify danger areas such as windows which may shatter or top-heavy furniture such as bookcases.
-   Keep a regular check on your emergency kit. Store water in airtight containers and replace every six months. Reckon on at least 14 litres
    (about three gallons) of water per person for a 72-hour period or longer. Ensure medication and food supplies are not past their use-by dates.
    Make sure portable radio, flashlight and extra batteries are working. It doesn’t take long for old flat batteries to leak and possibly
    damage other emergency supplies.
-   Devise a plan for reuniting family and friends after the disaster. You may be at work. Children may be at school. Transportation and
    communication may be disrupted.

### During the earthquake

Stay where you are. Take cover against an inside wall or strong internal doorway. Avoid exterior walls, doors, heavy furniture or appliances. Do
NOT rush outside—you may be injured by falling glass or masonry.

-   If you are outside, get into the open away from power lines, buildings and lampposts.
-   If you are in a crowded public place, do NOT make a dash for the exit—everyone else will have the same idea. Take cover, away from the
    risk of falling objects/debris.
-   If you’re in a tall building, such as an office block, get under a heavy desk away from exterior walls and windows. Do NOT use stairs or
    lifts in an attempt to get to lower floors-most people are injured when moving around.
-   Extinguish candles and naked flames in case of fire or gas explosion. If you smell gas, DON’T smoke.
-   Do NOT take refuge in cellars, subways or underground tunnels. Exits could cave in or become blocked.
-   If you’re driving, STOP. Do NOT get out—your vehicle will offer some protection. Crouch below seat level if possible. Do NOT stop on
    bridges, near buildings, or under trees, electrical power lines or large signs in case they collapse.
-   Aftershocks have been known to occur anything from one minute to a year later! Most happen 24-48 hours after the main tremor and cause further
    damage to already weakened structures. Wait until you get the all-clear from police or rescue teams before leaving safety.

### After the earthquake

Check for injuries. Apply first aid if necessary or wait for help. Leave severely damaged buildings in case of further collapse. Only return when
authorities deem it safe to do so.

-   Wear sturdy shoes to prevent injury from fallen masonry and glass.
-   Clean up spilled household chemicals and potentially-harmful substances.
-   Gas leaks and damaged electrical wiring are major fire hazards. Shut off at the mains if damage is suspected and do not turn back on until
    checked by specialists.
-   Do NOT smoke or operate electrical appliances if a gas leak is suspected—even a telephone could create a spark sufficient to cause an
    explosion.

:::info[TSUNAMI]

Often more devastating than an earthquake itself is the tsunami (pronounced soo-name-ee) or ‘tidal’ wave which can follow as a result
of underwater disturbance. More than 200 tsunamis have been reported in the Pacific in this century alone, some of which have resulted in
waves more than 30m (100ft) high smashing into the coast with enormous destructive power. Earthquakes don’t always cause tsunamis, but
they may also be generated by underwater landslides and major volcanic eruptions.

Tsunamis are capable of travelling enormous distances. Although they move quickly, there is usually time for adequate warning. A tsunami
generated on the coast of Chile, for example, would take about ten hours to reach Hawaii.

A major problem associated with a tsunami warning is that people allow their curiosity to overcome their common sense. When Berkeley,
California received a warning during the Alaskan earthquake of 1964, the Chief of Police later complained that not only did local people go to
the shoreline to watch for the great wave, so did some of his staff!

It’s VITAL to understand that a tsunami is not usually ONE wave but a series. People can be fooled into returning to the danger area after
the first wave, only to meet their deaths under the onslaught of a second or third. At Crescent City, California, during the same Alaskan
earthquake, seven people went back to a pub in the flooded area to collect their valuables after the first and second waves had passed.
Assuming the danger was over, they stayed for a drink and were hit by a third wave. Five of them were drowned.

:::

-   If you can see that water pipes are damaged, shut off the supply. Check with local emergency officials whether sewage pipes are intact before
    flushing toilets. Plug bath and sink drainholes to prevent sewage back-up.
-   Weakened chimneys can topple during an aftershock-approach with caution. Do not use a damaged chimney. A major fire could start.
-   Beware of items falling out when you open cupboard doors.
-   Do not use the telephone except in an absolute emergency. You could tie up much-needed lines for the rescue services.
-   Check food and water supplies. Take great care over hygiene and sanitation.
-   Do NOT use your car except in an emergency—roads may be impassable. Keep streets clear for rescue vehicles.
-   Do NOT go out sightseeing. Apart from the danger to yourself, you could hinder rescue efforts.
-   Listen for up-to-date emergency information on your portable radio.

Earthquakes can cause mudslides and landslides which may necessitate evacuation in your area. People living in coastal areas should be
particularly aware of the possibility of tsunamis (sometimes called, incorrectly, ‘tidal’ waves). When a warning is issued, stay away from
the shoreline and prepare for evacuation. Do not attempt to save possessions when your family, friends or other people are in danger.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

It is essential to stay as quiet as possible if rescuers are searching rubble for survivors. They need to be able to hear even the faintest
cries for help. Unless you are told to evacuate, you should help search the immediate area—but only when you KNOW it’s safe to go
outside.

:::

## **VOLCANO**

When the volcanic island of Krakatoa in Indonesia suddenly exploded in 1883 the blast was so violent that the sound could be heard 3000 miles away
across the Indian Ocean Clouds of ash and dust were ejected into the atmosphere with such force that it took almost two years for it all to fall
back to earth.

Altogether there are 1343 known active volcanoes around the world, Indonesia boasting the highest number—200. There is also a high
concentration around the Pacific, though Europe has a few such as Mount Etna in Sicily, Vesuvius in Italy and Hekla in Iceland.

Volcanic eruptions of the earth’s interior core matter, usually where the crust is deeply fissured, can cause fierce explosions of lava,
gases, dust and rock—particularly in a’central’ volcano, which has the recognizable cone. Why a volcano should decide to erupt,
perhaps after hundreds of years of apparent dormancy, is usually linked to viscous lava clogging up the cone of the volcano and causing a massive
pressure build-up.

There are also instances where local earthquakes have triggered off a volcanic eruption—a bit like shaking up a bottle of fizzy drink. Such
was the case in the eruption of Mount Saint Helens, Washington, in 1980, where 65 people were killed-including a professional volcanologist!

Given the cataclysmic nature of an erupting volcano, and the speed at which molten lava can travel, you would be forgiven for thinking that
survival would be in the lap of the gods. However there are usually visible warning signs weeks before an eruption and, even if prior evacuation
has not been possible, there are emergency precautions you can take.

### Advance warnings

A volcano may ‘grumble’ on and off for years, letting everyone know that they can expect an eruption sooner or later. On the other hand,
the eruption may take place in a few hours or days. DON’T take chances! DON’T climb a volcano for a closer look. Pay attention to:

-   Audible rumblings from the volcano or the ground
-   Ash and gases appearing from the cone, the sides or round the volcano
-   Earth movement, whether faint tremors or earthquakes
-   Presence of pumice dust in the air
-   Acid rain fall
-   Steam in clouds over the mouth of the volcano
-   Rotten egg smell near rivers, betraying presence of sulphur

### Emergency procedure

-   Leave the area immediately. Do NOT waste time trying to save possessions.
-   Be prepared for difficult travelling conditions. If vehicles get bogged in deep ash you may have no choice but to abandon them, in which case
    run for the nearest road out of the area. You may be able to hitch a lift.
-   Avoid areas downwind from the volcano if ash is being expelled. Use a scarf or wet handkerchief as a mask—the combination of ash and
    acidic gas can cause lung damage.
-   Protect eyes with any snug-fitting goggles.
-   Beware flying debris-any hat stuffed with newspaper might help prevent head injury. Wear thick padded clothing for body protection.
-   Always check for mudflows when approaching a stream channel. A mudflow can move faster than anyone can run-even buildings may not stop one.
-   Shelter in buildings (other than emergency refuges) ONLY as a last resort. Walls can be crushed by rocks and lava. Roofs are subject to
    collapse, even from just the weight of ash and debris.

:::info[NUEE ARDENTE]

A nuee ardente is the scientific name for a rapidly-moving, incandescent cloud of gas, ash and rock fragments accompanying a volcanic
eruption. Faced with a red hot cloud travelling at more than 160kph (100mph), you only have two choices. Either shelter in an underground
emergency refuge or hold your breath and submerge yourself underwater—in a river, a lake, the sea. The danger may pass in 30 seconds or
so.

:::

## **HURRICANE**

A hurricane is a severe tropical storm capable of releasing as much energy in one day as a one megaton hydrogen bomb. Also known as a cyclone
(literally ‘coil of the snake’) or typhoon, a hurricane can travel up to 300kmph (about 200mph)-bringing with it storm surges, flash
flooding and tornadoes and leaving a phenomenal trail of destruction in its wake.

Hurricanes have caused more damage in the United States than any other type of natural disaster. As many as 50 countries with a total of 500
million population are exposed to the risk every year.

True hurricanes never form in cooler European waters. From June through to November, the US, Hawaiian islands and Caribbean are at their most
vulnerable. In the steamy tropics the general weather conditions are favourable to hurricanes virtually every day.

:::info[MEASURING HURRICANES]

International classification of hurricanes is usually based on wind speeds measured over one, three or five minutes or in single gusts. Wind
speeds are often expressed on the Beaufort Scale, although in the US the common classification is simply:

1 Tropical storm  
2 Severe tropical storm  
3 Hurricane

STRONG GALE  
Wind speed: 75-88kph (46-55mph) Beaufort scale: 9 Likely effects: Leaves and small branches stripped )off trees. Structural damage
to buildings unlikely.

VIOLENT STORM  
Wind speed: 103-114kph (64-71mph) Beaufort scale: 11 Likely effects: Large branches snapped off trees. Shallow-rooted trees may
fall. Roof and other structural damage. Fences blown down. Lorries blown over. People blown over.

HURRICANE  
Wind speed: 117kph plus (73mph plus) Beaufort scale: 12 and over Likely effects: Widespread damage. Weak structures flattened, roofs
blown away. Trees blown down. A large amount of airborne debris. Windows blown in. Shelter for people essential.

:::

No one can explain exactly why a hurricane develops. It starts at sea as a centre of low pressure. Given the right combination of atmospheric
conditions, it can gather energy from evaporated water in the ocean, whipping into a whirling windforce. The result is a spiralling
catherine-wheel effect, with a calm ‘eye’ in the centre, which may exceed 40km (25 miles) in diameter.

A hurricane could cover 1.3 million square kilometres (500,000 sq miles) and last up to three weeks before blowing itself out, usually over land.
Small wonder that anything caught in the eye is virtually helpless. The eye of Hurricane Carla in 1961 was packed so tightly with trapped birds
that observatory weather planes were unable to fly through it!

Enormous destructive power aside, the hurricane has another deadly secret weapon—unpredictability. Despite world observatories’ facility
to spot and monitor hurricane activity, thanks to satellites and radar, there is still no way to predict when and where a hurricane may strike.

Hurricanes are able to ‘loop the loop’ without warning-Typhoon Wayne doubled back on itself three times before hitting China in 1986.
International collaborations such as Spectrum (formed in 1991) have been set up to conduct research into hurricane behaviour, but it will be years
before reliable warnings are possible.

These days, the catastrophic effect of hurricanes is being reduced as a result of better designed housing in affected areas. On the Florida coast,
for example, the hurricane death toll has fallen over the last 20 years, even though the area is more densely populated.

When Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin, Australia, in 1974, only 400 of the city’s 11,200 houses survived relatively intact. Darwin has been almost
totally rebuilt with hurricane-proof structures but (fortunately) they have yet to be tested.

### Naming hurricanes

Since 1953 hurricanes in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico have been given personal names devised by the World Meteorological
Organization as a means of identification. Originally they were named only after women, supposedly because of their unpredictable and capricious
behaviour! These days they are named alternatively with male or female names. Revised every six years, the names run alphabetically. 1991
hurricane names, for example, are Bob, Claudette through to Victor and Wanda. In the event of an extremely damaging hurricane a name is retired
permanently.

### Early warnings

Tracking stations around the world constantly monitor hurricane activity and provide up-to-date information to weather services. There are two
types of hurricane alert:

Hurricane watch This means that a hurricane MAY threaten coastal and inland areas, but it does NOT mean that a hurricane is imminent. Action:
Listen for further information on your local radio and television stations and be prepared to act promptly.

Hurricane warning This means that a hurricane is expected to strike WITHIN 24 HOURS. Action: Keep listening for advice from local authorities and
act according to recommended emergency procedures.

### Getting prepared

### Before hurricane season

-   If you do not have a storm cellar, know where your nearest evacuation shelter is—it could save your life.
-   Check your house is sound, particularly the roof. The strongest winds in a hurricane occur immediately after the transit of the eye and blow
    in the OPPOSITE direction. It is then your house will be most vulnerable.
-   Keep your property clear of junk-a hurricane can turn it into missiles.
-   Check emergency supplies.

### After a hurricane warning

-   Keep the radio/TV on for more information and instructions. Watch out for warnings of tornadoes—often spawned by hurricanes.
-   Fill car with petrol and be prepared to evacuate if told by the emergency services to do so.
-   Leave low-lying/coastal areas that might be swept by high tides or floods.
-   Leave mobile homes for substantial shelter. Caravans are prone to overturning in strong winds.
-   Secure outside objects. Even fridges have been known to take flight in hurricanes.
-   Board up windows to prevent breakage through debris or wind pressure.
-   Store drinking water in clean bathtubs, sinks and containers. Water systems may be damaged or contaminated in the storm.
-   Lock up pets.

### During a hurricane

-   If you are unable to evacuate and you do not have a cellar, shelter in the strongest part of the house—under the stairs, perhaps. Take
    emergency supplies with you.
-   Do not shelter near an internal chimney breast. Even in Britain’s gale of October 1987 people were killed when chimneys collapsed through
    ceilings.
-   If the house starts to break up, protect yourself with mattresses and blankets or get under a strong bed.
-   Stay inside-high winds and flying debris can be lethal.
-   Do NOT drive-cars are no protection in a hurricane.
-   Do NOT be fooled by the calm eye! If the storm centre passes directly overhead there may be a lull lasting anything from a few minutes to an
    hour, before the wind picks up to hurricane speed again in the OPPOSITE direction.

### After the storm

-   Apply first aid to any casualties.
-   Stay where you are until given the all-clear.
-   Listen for information on radio/TV stations.
-   Do NOT go sightseeing-you may interfere with rescue work and put yourself in danger.
-   Drive ONLY when necessary-roads may be littered with debris and should be kept open for emergency services.
-   Do not use telephone unless an emergency. You could tie up lines needed for rescue services.
-   Report broken power cables, water, gas and sewage mains.
-   Prevent fires-fire-fighting could be impaired because of low water pressure.
-   Eat perishable foods first if electricity is cut off you don’t know how long you may have to rely on your existing food supplies.

## **TORNADO**

The low, train-like rumbling of a tornado approaching is indeed an awesome sound, for it brings with it one of nature’s most violent storms.
With whirling winds of up to 300kph (about 200mph), a tornado has a funnel-type effect causing everything in its path, apart from the most solid
structures, to be sucked up as if into a giant vacuum cleaner. The pressure is sufficient to lift light buildings—at the very least, doors
and windows can be sucked out.

Fortunately, the base of a tornado is usually only 25-50m (82-164ft) across, which reduces the level of destruction to a smaller area. Also,
unlike hurricanes, tornadoes normally only travel up to 16 kilometres (ten miles) before petering out. That is not to say that their power should
be underestimated! Tornadoes can strike at any time of the year and often occur on the fringe of hurricanes.

Even Britain has had its share of tornadoes, albeit on a small scale. The Newmarket tornado of 1978 caused &pound;1 million of property damage. In
1981, 58 tornadoes were reported in one day in an area from Anglesey to the eastern coast.

### Tornado precautions

Emergency procedures before, during and after a tornado warning are much the same as for hurricanes, though there are a few extra precautions
which should be taken:

-   The best protection is an underground shelter or basement of a steel-flamed or reinforced-concrete building. If none of these is available,
    take cover on the lowest floor in the centre of the house, under a strong table, making sure there are no heavy appliances above. This should
    reduce the risk of injury if walls collapse. Stay away from windows!
-   As the tornado approaches, CLOSE all doors and windows facing the storm and OPEN all those on the opposite side. The aim is to equalize
    pressure inside and outside to prevent the roof being sucked away or the building collapsing.
-   If outside, do not attempt to escape—not even in a car.
-   If there is no shelter nearby, lie flat in a ditch or ground depression and cover your head. You will stand less chance of being sucked up by
    the tornado or hit by flying debris.

## **FLOOD**

Flooding may not have the same dramatic impact as an erupting volcano, say, or the effects of a monumental earthquake, but it is probably one of
the most common and widespread natural disasters worldwide. The statistics are horrendous.

Flooding can occur for many reasons—heavy rainfall (particularly in valleys after prolonged spells of hot dry weather), snow melting on
mountains, rivers changing course, dams collapsing and high tides in coastal areas. The Thames Barrier in London was constructed to prevent
flooding during a North Sea surge. This is where high tides combine with low pressure and north or north westerly winds, as far away as Scotland,
to push waves down the eastern coast of England, gathering force and raising sea levels.

Living close to the sea is immensely popular, despite vulnerability from eroding sea walls, but the squeeze for land has meant housing estates may
be built in (frankly) unsuitable areas, such as the flood plains of rivers. If ‘global warming’ has the effects predicted, it is estimated
that by the year 2050 sea levels could rise by as much as 50cm (20in). It may not sound much, but it could mean that many areas of the world could
be drastically affected by the constant threat of floods.

### Getting prepared

Fortunately, weather centres can usually predict flooding and so give early warning to local authorities and the media. Advance warning can be
anything from a few hours to a few days, so there’s normally time to organize yourself before water starts heading your way.

### Before the flood

-   If you live in a known risk area, find out the official flood height which will affect your house (from your local council) to help you act
    accordingly.
-   Listen constantly for radio and TV reports.
-   Turn off electricity as threat becomes more immediate. Do NOT wait until water has entered the house and risk electrocution.
-   Turn off gas in case of potential damage and leaks.
-   Block gaps outside doors with sandbags, usually provided by the emergency services. If not available, improvise with plastic bags or
    pillowcases filled with earth or gravel, or stuff cracks with old blankets and carpets.
-   NEVER stack sandbags round the outside walls to keep water out of a basement. Water seepage could cause pressure that could damage the walls
    or even raise the basement out of the ground. Better to fill the basement yourself with clean water if you think flooding will occur. It will
    equalize pressure to prevent structural damage and will make cleaning up afterwards easier.
-   Sandbag exterior windowsills if it looks like water will rise that far.
-   Move to the upper floors, taking emergency supplies, pets and any valuables/papers you simply cannot live without. REMEMBER: Lives are more
    important than possessions.
-   Take spare clothes and shoes with you-the flood may be around for days.
-   Fill baths and containers with water-supplies may become contaminated.
-   Brightly coloured cloth is useful for signalling for help.

:::info[FLASH FLOODS]

Flash floods can be deadly and highly unexpected, unless you know the danger signs. They are common when torrential rain follows a long dry
spell. The ground cannot absorb the rainfall quickly enough and the flood begins.

Alice Springs in Australia’s ‘red centre’ suffers from an incredibly arid and desert climate with summer temperatures around the
45&deg;C (113&deg;F) mark. So permanently dry is the town’s Todd River that they hold an annual Henleyon-Todd Regatta. Competitors run up
and down the river bed in bottomless boats with their legs sticking out (like ‘Flintstones’ cars)! Yet every couple of years surprise
storms transform the river bed from a barren desert to a raging torrent. Many people have drowned under the force and speed of the first
onslaught of water.

Flash floods occur all over the world. If a flash flood is imminent or leaves you stranded outdoors:

-   Seek shelter on higher ground immediately. REMEMBER: You don’t have to be at the bottom of a hill to be on low ground!
-   If your car stalls, abandon it. You and your vehicle could be swept away
-   Do not try to swim-the currents are deadly
-   Do not try to cross a fast-moving stream unless you are POSITIVE it is no more than knee height. It may look safe, but the current could
    still be strong enough to sweep you off your feet

:::

### During the flood

-   Keep listening to reports on your portable radio.
-   Keep a constant watch on what’s happening outside.
-   Stay where you are, unless told to evacuate-travelling could put you at even greater risk.
-   NEVER drink floodwater-it may carry disease.
-   Do NOT use telephone except in dire emergency.
-   Obey officials if told to evacuate.
-   If life is endangered, get onto the roof and signal for help.
-   Only in extreme emergency should you attempt to make a raft-flood water moves very fast and you may put yourself at greater risk.

### After the flood

-   Do NOT go outside until you know it’s safe-more storms ‘could be on the way.
-   Boil or purify ALL water, until local authorities declare municipal supply safe. Flood water could have contaminated the cold water mains
    supply.
-   Do NOT use flesh food or water that has come into contact with flood water.
-   Do NOT turn on electricity or gas until told to do so.
-   In likely areas, beware poisonous snakes or spiders seeking refuge in your home.
-   Beware contracting diseases from paddling in flood water.
-   Wear strong shoes when walking through subsided flood water-you could step on sharp debris or broken glass.
-   Check drains carefully for blockage—they could pose a hygiene threat if not cleared properly.

## **LIGHTNING**

Every year there’s an average of six lightning strikes per square mile in Britain alone-that’s about 4200 just over London. Amazingly
enough few people are actually killed (around 12 per annum is the national average), though many are seriously injured or burned. If you are
outdoors in a thunderstorm and you feel your hair start to stand on end, that’s a sure indication that lightning is about to strike.

-   Drop to your knees IMMEDIATELY. Bend forward, putting your hands on your knees. That way if lightning strikes the electrical charge may pass
    through your limbs to the ground, bypassing your heart.
-   Do NOT hold metal objects (such as golf clubs) and keep away from metal structures they will attract lightning.
-   Do NOT stand under a tall isolated tree in an open area—it could act as a lightning conductor.
-   Do NOT stand on a hilltop where you would project above the landscape-YOU could act as a lightning conductor!
-   Seek shelter in a low area in dense shrubbery.
-   Even rubber-soled shoes are no guarantee of safety.

## **DROUGHT**

Recent years have seen an unparalleled awareness of drought in Britain and many other countries. No longer is it something that happens to other
people! From hosepipe fines and car-washing bans, even tap water cannot be relied on for drinking as reservoirs sink to new lows. Yet for many
countries, drought is a simple fact of life. In parts of the Middle East, for example, the only drinking water comes from the sea, having
undergone processing in huge desalination plants. In many other areas of the world, drought survival is about water conservation, eking out every
precious drop in the hope that supplies will not run out before the next rainfall.

The city of Perth in Western Australia is a case in point. Every household is allotted a certain amount of water, and anyone exceeding it has to
pay for their excesses. Television news bulletins report overall weekly consumption compared to existing water supplies, and set new low
‘targets’ in an effort to reduce expenditure.

Fire, sanitation and disease are the main problems associated with drought, and if the current climatic changes are attributable to the
much-vaunted ‘greenhouse effect’, we may have no choice but to learn to live with them.

:::info[THE ‘GREENHOUSE EFFECT’]

Thanks to the burning of fossil fuels, use of CFCs and intense cultivation and deforestation, man is increasing the concentration of
‘greenhouse’ gases in the atmosphere. This, say scientists, could change the global climate, causing floods in some regions and
droughts in others. It is estimated that the average global surface temperature increased by 0.5&deg;C (0.9&deg;F) from 1900 to 1989. Unless
we change our ways we may accelerate the trend.

:::

### Living with drought

-   Do NOT waste water. A hosepipe BAN means exactly that, and could signal the start of severe water shortage.
-   Do NOT drink tap water if local authorities issue warnings to that effect. Shrinking water levels can result in contamination and, in extreme
    drought, dead animals may pollute water sources. Boil, purify, or buy bottled water.
-   If your water supply is cut off and mobile water tanks or standpipes are installed in streets, this is designed for drinking water ONLY. The
    situation is too severe to waste water on other uses.
-   Do NOT use the toilet, but leave enough water in the bowl to act as a barrier to prevent smells and possible disease spreading from sewers up
    the pipes.
-   Buy a camping chemical toilet. Alternatively, you may have to face making an outdoor latrine.
-   Re-use water as much as possible.
-   Ensure food is always covered-flies could prove a problem.
-   Try to practise good hygiene, despite lack of water, especially when preparing food. Hot unsanitary conditions are a breeding ground for
    germs.
-   Try to eat foods with a high moisture content (such as fruit) and which need little preparation or clearing up.
-   NEVER throw cigarette ends casually out of cars or anywhere else. Grass could be tinder-dry and fire-fighting services severely hampered.
-   If driving any distance, carry your own water in case the engine overheats. In Western Australia, it’s quite common to see the following
    sign in petrol stations: ‘Do not ask for water as a punch in the mouth often offends’!
-   Watch out for structural damage to houses, particularly those built on clay. You may have to fell trees too close to the house to prevent the
    roots causing damage to foundations.

## **THE BIG FREEZE**

The picture postcard romance of a snow-laden landscape soon begins to wear thin when the harsh reality of winter sets in-blizzards, snow drifts,
arctic winds at more than 55kph (35mph) and freezing temperatures which, with the wind chill factor, can be the equivalent of-40&deg;C (-
104&deg;F).

Even areas which normally experience mild winters can suddenly be hit with blizzards and extreme cold, rendering entire cities powerless for days.
The result is always human suffering and, all too often, death.

Unlike Britain, where two centimetres (less than an inch) of light snow can bring the nation to a standstill, many countries such as Norway and
Finland have had to invent ways of coping with the extreme winter conditions as part of everyday survival. In Alaska and regions of the Soviet
Union, for example, houses are built on stilts because conventional foundations would buckle in the permafrost soil.

Canada sees 140 days of snow every year, and there are many lessons to be learnt from their approach to winter living. House insulation is
paramount, pipes are submerged below the frost line, a second set of ‘storm windows’ is the norm, and people can even buy plastic draught
excluders which fit into electrical sockets on exterior walls to prevent every tiny bit of heat escaping! Cars are ‘winterised’ with snow
chains, gasohol (anti-freeze for petrol), plug-in block heaters to keep the engine warm overnight. People never drive with less than half a tank
of petrol in case moisture in the air in the tank freezes and causes the vehicle to stall.

Winter complacency, underestimation of the severity of conditions, lack of preparation and, often, lack of common sense are all contributing
factors to unnecessary deaths—from what is after all a seasonal event. But with a little preparation before the cold starts to bite, you can
be ready for the worst that winter can bring.

### Getting prepared

-   Ensure your house is well-insulated, especially the loft. Lag pipes to prevent freezing and insulate the hot water tank to prevent heat loss.
    Don’t continue loft insulation under a cold-water cistern—the small amount of heat beneath it may keep it from freezing.
-   Check for draughts around exterior doors and windows. A heavy curtain over the front door can make halls warmer. Plastic sheeting taped over
    windows is a simple, cheap alternative to double glazing.
-   Service central heating—it has a habit of going wrong when it’s most needed.
-   Kitchen foil, fixed shiny side out on walls behind radiators, will reflect heat.
-   Check electrical fires are in good working order. Many winter deaths are caused through occasionally-used electrical fires which prove to be
    faulty.
-   Electric blankets should be serviced ANNUALLY.
-   If you have an unused fireplace, get it cleaned and unblocked and stock up on fuel. It could prove a last-resort.
-   Check emergency kit and supplies (see beginning of this section). A camp stove could be vital, especially if you have an electric hob or oven.
-   Food is fuel for the body. Ensure you have enough supplies for at least three days, but resist the temptation to stockpile. You don’t
    really need 15 loaves of bread to see you through a winter emergency in a town or city and you could cause hardship for other people.
-   Make sure you have enough winter clothing.

### During bad weather

-   Listen to radio/TV for weather reports and emergency information. Call social services if you need help for yourself or a relative living
    alone.
-   Have emergency supplies at hand in case of power failure.
-   Live in one room, if you can’t keep the whole house heated.
-   Do not block all ventilation—avoid build-up of potentially toxic fumes from fires and heaters.
-   Drink plenty of hot drinks to make you feel warmer.
-   If your pipes freeze, shut off water at the mains and turn on all taps to drain the system in case of burst pipes. Drain water into containers
    to ensure an adequate supply.
-   If there is power failure, do NOT open freezer. A closed freezer should stay frozen for up to 48 hours.
-   If central heating does fail, turn it off as a safety measure.

### If you must go outside

-   Dress accordingly. Several thin layers are warmer than one ‘thick one. Mittens are warmer than gloves, and hats will prevent heat loss.
    Frostbite and hypothermia are SERIOUS hazards.
-   Avoid over-exertion. The combination of excessive physical activity and cold can KILL.
-   Do NOT drink alcohol. It lowers the body temperature.
-   Do NOT dry wet clothes on or too close to heaters-it’s a major fire risk.

:::info[HYPOTHERMIA]

Hypothermia is a killer, particularly for elderly people. Initial signs are clumsiness, disorientation and drowsiness. As cooling of body
temperature progresses, the individual becomes less active, paler and may become deeply comatose. Rewarm the casualty’s body around the
ribs and heart first to increase the ‘core’ temperature—NOT the extremities. If casualty is conscious, give a warm sweet drink.
Seek urgent medical attention ([see also HEALTH: Save a life!](/sas-urban/urban-health#save-a-life)).
