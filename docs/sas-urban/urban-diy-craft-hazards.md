More and more DIY tools and products are appearing on the market&mdash;statistics indicate that do-it-yourself is increasing likely to become a
case of do-it-TO-yourself! Knowing the risks should help you to avoid serious injury.

## **DOING IT YOURSELF**

There is a growing interest and participation in &#39;having a go&#39; at home improvements of one sort or another. The number of possible dangers
is very high&mdash;depending on each individual&#39;s level of skill, the complexity of tasks undertaken and the levels of risk involved for the
amateur.

Some people will never lift a screwdriver in their lives, others will attempt to build extensions to their homes-or complete new homes.

### Most common injuries

In Britain alone this &#39;have a go&#39; enthusiasm results in an estimated 120,000 casualties a year. Cuts to the hands and fingers from knives,
saws, screwdrivers and chisels are the most common injuries&mdash;accounting for almost a quarter of the total. An enormous number of injuries are
caused by nails, screws and tacks!

Falls from tripping over cables and dust sheets or falling downstairs, falling off stools / chairs / trestles / boxes account for almost as many
casualties. Careless or casual use of ladders and stepladders results in some very serious falls.

Less common-but still far TOO common(in decreasing order of frequency) is the number of people who hit themselves with hammers, injure themselves
with power tools and get things in their eyes, sometimes dust and sometimes major debris.

### Why do it yourself?

Most people who have been injured while indulging in do it-yourself&mdash;even only at the hobby level&mdash;give the same answers. The factors
that seem to drive the enthusiasts on are quite understandable:

- It is difficult to find reliable professional workers.
- The cost of using professionals may be prohibitive.
- Thousands of DIY products are available.
- Hundreds of handy &#39;gadgets&#39; are available.
- There&#39;s a thrill to learning a new process.
- There is great satisfaction in a job well done.

It&#39;s very true that today&#39;s paints and wallpapers are better made and easier to apply. Kit-form furniture is common, but even without it
there are lots of fittings and gadgets around which have made traditional joinery unnecessary for the amateur. But easier doesn&#39;t mean SAFER.

### Danger factors

Many home improvers learn the hard way, practising new skills with each job they undertake. Inadequate safety precautions, not reading safety
instructions with tools, the lack of safety instructions with traditional tools and an incomplete grasp of the dangers involved are a frightening
combination.

Add to these the fact that new tools, equipment and substances are introduced into the market on a regular basis and there has to be a first time
for every individual with each tool or process, however generally experienced the individual.

ALWAYS ask suppliers or even manufacturers for advice. ALWAYS read the safety instructions. Approach each new job with CAUTION, considering
possible hazards.

:::info[SAFETY CHECKLIST]

Many injuries are caused by:

- Incorrect use of tools and power tools
- Not using/not buying protective guards for power tools
- Not using/not buying dust and debris collectors, which are attached directly to power tools or enable a vacuum cleaner to be connected
- Lack of maintenance of power tools
- Incorrect use of hire tools or inadequate safety briefings
- Underestimating the strength required to operate some hire tools
- Lack of precautions against/understanding of electrocution
- Lack of protection: eyes, ears, nose, lungs, hands, feet, limbs, head
- Inadequate lighting while working
- Slippery or uneven floors, or carelessness with dust sheets
- Lack of fire precautions
- Inadequate ventilation
- Incorrect use of ladders/scaffolding/improvised ladders
- Misuse or misunderstanding of chemicals
- Incorrect storage of chemicals and equipment
- Lifting/carrying too heavy a load or lifting incorrectly
- Lack of care with glass
- Rushing to complete laborious tasks
- Not supporting or anchoring workpiece

:::
:::tip[REMEMBER]


Always work on a firm surface. A collapsible/portable workbench is a good idea&mdash;especially with adjustable grips to hold your work
steady.

:::
:::danger[Warning]


Walls, floors and ceilings conceal electric cables and pipes carrying water and gas. Take great care when nailing, screwing or drilling. Use a
battery-operated detector to avoid nasty accidents. Piercing a live cable could be FATAL (<a href="./urban-safety-first#electrocution">see SAFETY FIRST: Electrocution</a>).

:::

## **USING TOOLS**

It is not possible to give safety guidelines to cover every do-it-yourself process, nor is this intended to be a do-it-yourself manual. The
information about basic tools is intended to assist the inexperienced worker, to help prevent accidents. The prime concern is not to focus on
correct DIY techniques, nor to avoid damage to a piece of work (perhaps from a slip with a screwdriver), but to try to ensure the safety of the
user of the tool.

Experienced handypersons may find some of the information a little obvious, but should still benefit from a few reminders on safety!

### The work area

DON&#39;T leave tools lying around. Try to be methodical about putting them away. A toolbox or special cupboard will do, if you don&#39;t fancy
the idea of special racks. Put protective covers on (if you have them), especially on piercing tools like bradawls&mdash;a cork would do, jammed
on the end&mdash;and knives and chisels. If knife blades are removable, discard them at the end of working. You&#39;ll probably want a new blade
next time you use the knife.

Try to be tidy. You&#39;ll find things more easily, lower the injury risk of searching through piles of tools or tripping over them and make your
tools last longer.

### The floor

Keep floors as clear as you can, especially the immediate area where you expect to be working. Keep dust sheets flat and make sure they don&#39;t
slip on the floor below. Don&#39;t leave flexes and extension cables trailing about. If you spill any liquids, mop them up at once.

### Lighting

Keep the area well lit, with natural light when possible. Supplement this with inspection lights, spotlights or domestic lighting, bearing in mind
the possibilities of electrocution and fire. If fixing permanent work-area lighting, consider low-voltage options. Fixed appliances could have
their own separate illumination nearby. Don&#39;t work in your shadow!

### Ventilation

Ventilation is vitally important in several ways. You must NOT expose yourself or others to clouds of dust or fumes while working. Dust is a
long-term health hazard and breathing protection should be worn. Damp the floor before sweeping up, or use a mop. DON&#39;T sweep the dust when
dry, you will only recirculate it&mdash;and DON&#39;T use a domestic vacuum cleaner.

Vacuum cleaners trap larger particles of dust, but smaller ones can pass straight through the machine and become airborne again. If you have a
permanent work area, investing in an extractor fan would be a good idea.

Fumes also pose severe health risks. The fumes of some substances may be carcinogenic (cancer-causing) in the long term&mdash;in the short term
they may make you drowsy and incapable of using power tools safely.

Open windows and doors and try to get air moving through the work area. An accumulation of certain dusts and fumes may also present a risk of
explosion.

### Noise

Avoid excessive levels of noise, and wear hearing protectors whenever necessary. Don&#39;t operate noisy machinery for long periods of time
without a break. Remember: if the noise is loud enough, you won&#39;t be able to hear whatever else is going on around you. The doorbell or phone
may ring. Someone may call for help. The vibration could cause an object to fall from a shelf, out of your line of vision, and onto a heater.
Accident records show that almost anything is possible.

:::danger[Warning]


Children and pets should be excluded from the work area. All tools and chemicals should be locked out of the reach of children when not in
use.

:::

### Clearing up


At the end of the work period, try to clear the floor and tidy up tools and materials. Fix lids on paint and chemicals. Switch off and unplug
tools, appliances and heaters. Look round to see that everything is safe to be left.


Depending on how dirty the job has been, have a thorough wash or shower&mdash;not forgetting your hair and fingernails. Even the smallest traces
of some toxic substances could be injurious over a period of time.

:::tip[REMEMBER]


If disposing of any DIY rubbish in household rubbish collections, make sure it is all safe. Young children and pets seem to like rubbish bags.
You should NOT use the domestic waste system for toxic or dangerous substances. Wrap up broken glass or knife blades. Sharp objects may pierce
the refuse sack and badly cut hands or legs-maybe yours?

:::

## **BASIC TOOLS**


The use of even traditional workshop tools is risky. As new tools are added to the toolbox, the only way to familiarize yourself with them is to
use them. Suppliers, manufacturers and regular or professional tool-users may be able to advise you.


### Hammers/mallets/stone hammers


Hammers are for driving in nails and tacks. Depending on the style of hammer, one side of the head performs the basic nailing task. The other may
be a narrow rectangular head (A) for coping with small nails, too delicate for normal hammer blows, or for nailing into mouldings (cross-pein
hammer).


A rounded head (B) is really for use with sheet metal (hemispherical-pein). The more common claw head (C) is for removing protruding or
badly-driven nails (D).

<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img068_003.jpg" />
</figure>

<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img068_004.jpg" />
</figure>

DON&#39;T use hammers to bash wooden- or plastic-handled tools such as chisels or screwdrivers. Cheap or thin-handled claw hammers should be
avoided&mdash;they may snap when you are trying to pull out deep or stubborn nails.

:::danger[Warning]


If you miss badly with a hammer, and the handle takes the blow behind the head, the handle may snap-and the head may fly off. Don&#39;t raise
the hammer excessively. Several medium blows are better than a couple of very hefty ones. Always check that the handle is sound and the head
well-fixed.

:::

Mallets (E) are for tapping wood- or plastic-handled tools such as chisels OR for tapping joints together when assembling joinery. Rubber- or
leather-faced hammers (F) are available for more delicate work.

<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img068_005.jpg" />

</figure>
Heavy club hammers are used with special (cold) chisels to chip into concrete, bricks or paving slabs.
:::danger[Warning]


If using a club hammer and cold chisel on stone or very hard surfaces, ALWAYS wear eye protection and strong gloves. Debris has an uncanny
knack of finding your eyes. A misdirected blow could damage your hand. Watch out for the &#39;burrs&#39; which occur on the chisel top alter a
while. These could cut a hand or break and fly off. File them down.

### Screwdrivers
Square-ended screwdrivers (G) should fit the screws you are using them for (H). It is worth having more than one size-or a GOOD QUALITY set with
interchangeable bits. Ordinary screwdrivers can be hard work&mdash;blisters are common.

Rachet screwdrivers (I) are handy&mdash;you don&#39;t have to release your grip. Most are adjustable to provide the rachet action for screwing or
unscrewing, plus a fixed position to allow for use as a conventional screwdriver.

Spiral-rachet screwdrivers (J) are a must for the serious DIY enthusiast or professional, but USE WITH CARE. When released, these tools shoot out
to full length and could easily take out an eye or pierce the skin. NEVER point towards your face or at anyone. Slips with these tools can often
be very nasty. Keep an eye on where the bit will go if you DO slip. With spiral-rachet screwdrivers, close the tool for final tightening of
screws. Most have interchangeable bits.

<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img068_008.jpg" />
</figure>

Cross-headed screwdrivers (K) should also fit the screws that they are used for (L)&mdash;in practice, only one small &#39;electrical&#39; one,
and one larger type are needed.

Electrical screwdrivers (M) should offer genuine protection from accidents with electricity. Handles should be shielded with rubber. Some double
as &#39;testers&#39;-a neon, or similar, in the handle lights up if the screwdriver touches a live terminal or wire. NEVER work on appliances
which are connected to the main supply. NEVER work on a live circuit.

### Using screws

Avoid undue pressure, which might cause an accident, when driving in screws by:

- Drilling correct pilot holes.
- Lubricating the threads only of screws with oil or grease&mdash;NOT the head-this increases the risk of slipping.
- Not using too long a screw.
- Using a screwdriver that fits the screw.

:::danger[Warning]


If a square-ended screwdriver shows wear and tear-reshape the tip, or ask a dealer to have it done for you. A worn rip increases the chance of
slipping or fouling the head of the screw, producing sharp burrs.

:::

### Chisels


If you intend to use chisels, perhaps to cut a slot for a hinge or to fit a lock, one is not enough. You will need several. Store them
safely-either with the ends covered, or in a rack-and keep them very sharp. A blunt chisel requires force and accidents are common. Sharpening is
a critical process involving an oilstone&mdash;and can take a lot of practice.

:::danger[Warning]


NEVER exert great pressure on a chisel or screwdriver with your hand or any other part of your body in direct &#39;line of fire&#39; if you
slip. ALWAYS work on a firm surface-not on your lap!

:::
Always remove wood PATIENTLY in small amounts, NOT by digging and gouging. If chisel is sharp it should do the work for you.
Mortise (A) and firmer (B) chisels are mainly for CHOPPING OUT wood.
<figure class="text--center">
<img src="/images/img069_001.jpg"
/>

</figure>
Paring (C) chisels are for SHAVING AWAY wood to clean up&mdash;not for levering.
<figure class="text--center">
<img src="/images/img069_002.jpg"
/>

</figure>

### Bradawls/awls


Whether square-ended (bradawl) or pointed (awl), they may be good enough to make pilot holes for screws in softwood. Keep them sharp. DON&#39;T
use a lot of pressure. DON&#39;T get in the &#39;line of fire&#39; if you slip&mdash;NEVER work into your hand or on your lap. Protect tips and
your fingers by jamming a cork on the points when not in use.

<figure class="text--center">
<img src="/images/img069_003.jpg"
/>

</figure>

### Saws


There is a wide variety of saws. They must be kept sharp (a dealer can arrange this for you) and rust-free. Saws with big teeth are intended to
rip through softwood quickly&mdash;cutting on the downward stroke. Smaller teeth imply finer work-possibly for plywood or chipboard. The shape of
the teeth may mean that more wood is removed on the downward stroke. A dealer will advise you for your specific needs.

Large teeth are intended to follow the grain&mdash;panel saws with about nine teeth to 25mm (1in) are more versatile.
<figure class="text--center">
<img src="/images/img070_001.jpg"
/>

</figure>
Tenon saws, with small teeth&mdash;about 15 to 25mm (1in)&mdash;work well with or across the grain.
<figure class="text--center">
<img src="/images/img070_002.jpg"
/>

</figure>

Tenon saws are for cutting joints in joinery (mortise-and tenon joints!) and fine work on smaller jobs requiring more care. Most have a
strengthening bar along the top edge of the blade, which restricts the depth of cut, so you won&#39;t be able to saw sheet materials.

:::tip[REMEMBER]


- KEEP saws sharp, clean and oiled
- Avoid using saws which have been bent or buckled
- Hang up saws when not in use
- The saw is supposed to do most of the work-if you&#39;re using excessive pressure, either the saw is blunt or it&#39;s the wrong saw for the job
- ALWAYS saw on a steady surface and anchor the work piece
- ALWAYS support as much of the wood as possible. When the waste wood falls (which you should avoid), the rest may topple off supports
- DON&#39;T saw between two supports, allowing the wood to droop down at the cutting point. This will close the cutting line, gripping the saw
- Keep your fingers well away from the cutting line
- When starting a cut, you may need a thumb to stop the blade &#39;jumping off&#39; the cut line. Start very slowly with light controlled
strokes, until the blade is established in the wood

:::

### Hacksaws


A hacksaw (A) is a basic tool for cutting metal bars or strips, angle-iron, metal and plastic pipes. The flame holds the blade
taut&mdash;don&#39;t overtighten, you may cause it to snap. Some types allow for the blade to be set at different angles. The frame limits the
depth of cut possible&mdash;when it hits the workpiece, you have gone as far as you can. It&#39;s not suitable for sheet metal, unless you are
making small straight cuts at the edges.


The blade should point downwards&mdash;away from the top frame-not upwards. Cutting pressure should be on the forward stroke (away from you). Keep
your free hand on top of the flame, at the front (away from you) to steady and guide the saw. Try to use long controlled strokes. Try to anchor
the workpiece in a vice.

Small hacksaws (B) are called &#39;junior&#39; hacksaws. If you are cutting hard steel, they aren&#39;t really strong enough.

Change blades regularly and ask a dealer for advice. There are different types and qualities of blade&mdash;usually with different size
teeth&mdash;for different jobs or degrees of finish. NEVER use if the blade is twisted or cracked.


<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img070_003.jpg" />
</figure>

There is a wide range of files with different profiles&mdash;square, half-round, triangular. For very fine work, use needle files.


### Rasps/files


Most are designed to remove material on the forward stroke. Some have removable handles-NEVER use without the handle! It&#39;s quite possible to
drive the unprotected point (tang) right into your hand. Tap the rasp/file handle downwards on the bench (C) to make sure the handle is secure.
Hold the handle firmly, steadying the other end with the tips of your fingers. Use a steady even pressure. Don&#39;t work fast&mdash;be patient
and let the tool do the work. If the face of the tool becomes clogged, give it a good stiff brushing.


### Craft knives


Basically a sturdy handle, which can be opened to allow a new blade to be fitted. Choose one that suits your grip. Retractable blade options are a
good idea, if the knife is good quality. Blade covers that come with non-retractable types get lost, or don&#39;t fit the other blade shapes that
are available. The blade cover could also come off in a pocket, perhaps!


ALWAYS change the blade as soon as it becomes inefficient. You shouldn&#39;t have to use excessive pressure. The blade is supposed to do the work.
ALWAYS buy the correct blades for the make of handle&mdash;a sloppy fit is no good. Some of the fancy/ specialist blade shapes are
useful&mdash;but also quite deadly.


<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img071_001.jpg" />
</figure>

Some retractable knives accept ordinary reversible blades. Others allow you to snap off the blunt end as you go. For very fine work, scalpels
offer precision and control.


NEVER twist or gouge with the blade. The tip might break and fly off. Remove material slowly&mdash;not in large chunks. ALWAYS remove the blade
from non-retractable types when putting them away.


Smaller craft knives are advisable for smaller, or more delicate jobs. There&#39;s a wide range available. You hold the handle more like a
pencil&mdash;less like a weapon&mdash;and use a lot less pressure. Use the right tool for the right job!

:::tip[REMEMBER]
If throwing away knife blades, make sure you wrap them well to save nasty accidents. Picking up a rubbish bag, or brushing a leg against it,
could cause a severe injury.
:::

:::info[TOOL RULES]
- Always use a tool for the job it was designed to do
- Always use tools correctly&mdash;if it feels very awkward, STOP
- Keep hands and other parts of the body out of direct &#39;line of fire&#39;
- DON&#39;T use excessive force
- Keep &#39;sharp&#39; tools SHARP
- Check all tools for strength and SAFETY
- Store all tools safely&mdash;out of the reach of children
:::

## **POWER TOOLS**


There&#39;s a wide choice of makes and types of tool. The more expensive, top-of-the-range ones are usually intended for heavy-duty or
professional use. The lower-priced should be fine for occasional home use&mdash;as long as they are of good quality. Often the first thing to
fail, especially on drills, is the on/off switch from constant stopping and starting!


Power tools MUST be cleaned and serviced&mdash;how often depends on how often you use (or abuse) them. There are service departments of all the
major manufacturers practically everywhere.

:::tip[PLEASE NOTE]

Read the following safety notes in conjunction with later information on specific power tools. These notes apply to almost all power tools.
:::

### Before you begin


- DON&#39;T even start to use the tool if you are tired, drunk or feeling ill.
- If you&#39;re working outside, check it is not raining or likely to rain while you are working. DON&#39;T work standing on wet or damp ground.
Wear rubber-soled boots. The risk of ELECTROCUTION is always present.
- Make sure you are protected by an RCD/RCB/ELCB (<a href="./urban-safety-first#electrocution">see SAFETY FIRST: Electrocution</a>).
- Check that the drill bit/saw blade/attachment is firmly fixed.
- Consider whether you are using the correct tool for the job. If the appliance has a chuck key, remove it before switching on&mdash;likewise,
spanners and Allen keys!
- Clear the area where you intend to work. Prepare a solid surface to work on. Clamp the work if possible.
- Don&#39;t wear jewellery, loose clothing&mdash;gloves should fit and be kept away from anything which might entangle them. Tie long hair back
out of the way.
- Get ready the correct forms of protection: safety glasses, a face mask or respirator, ear protectors (at least).
- Clear children and pets out of the work area.

:::tip[REMEMBER]


Always choose tools which are &#39;double insulated&#39;&mdash;with plastic casings. The double-insulation symbol in most countries is two
small squares, one inside the other.

:::

- Check that the flex, plug and extension lead are in good condition. Fully unwind extension leads. Don&#39;t carry the tool by the flex.
- Make sure (if drilling into a wall, for example) that there are no concealed electrical cables or water or gas pipes.
- If a tool has a fitment for dust/debris extraction, fit it-or use the connector to attach a vacuum cleaner. Use only a cylinder or drum vacuum
cleaner&mdash;pointing the &#39;exhaust&#39; out of the work area, preferably outside. Small dangerous particles travel straight through
domestic vacuum cleaners (<a href="#angle-grinders">see Wood dust</a>).
- If the tool has a guard, make sure it is attached.
- Ensure the area is WELL VENTILATED.
- Make sure the power tool is switched off (or locked off&mdash;if that option is available) BEFORE plugging in and switching on at the socket.

:::danger[Warning]


Lock-on buttons on power tools are good for allowing you to ease your grip slightly-BUT . . . if you do have an accident, the tool will carry
on working and could do a lot of damage. If you&#39;re too tired to hold the on/off trigger down, perhaps you&#39;re too tired to be using the
tool!

:::

### While you work


- DON&#39;T block the ventilation holes on the tool.
- DON&#39;T force the tool, let it dictate the pace of working.
- DON&#39;T use the tool for jobs it was not intended to do.
- Keep an eye on where the flex is at all times. It should NOT be anywhere near the cutting/drilling/sanding site.
- Keep fingers away from the site-even gloves may become entangled, causing you to lose control of the tool.
- If you need to replace the bit/blade/attachment-SWITCH OFF and unplug the tool first.
- Make sure nothing around you can fall-vibrations can cause such an accident. Noise may prevent you from hearing what is happening.
- Never work over your head.
- Never work with the flex stretched tight. Use an extension cable (fully unwound) or move nearer the socket.
- Don&#39;t do anything which feels very awkward.
- Don&#39;t operate leaning at an angle on a ladder-or balancing on chairs, stools or trestles.
- Keep the area well ventilated to let dust out.
- Don&#39;t work in your shadow!
- Keep your fingers away from the &#39;lock-on&#39; button. On most tools these buttons are a very BAD idea.
- DON&#39;T move about holding the tool while it is switched on.
- CONCENTRATE!


### When you&#39;ve finished


- Remove dusty goggles so that you can see what you&#39;re doing-but not your mask.
- Switch off the tool and lay it down carefully when all moving parts come to rest.
- Go to the socket, switch off and unplug flex.
- Coil extension cables safely.
- Remove the bit/blade.
- Brush the tool over to remove dust and debris (keeping your mask on).
- Damp down any dust/shavings before sweeping up. A vacuum cleaner will recirculate dangerous particles&mdash;even wood dust should not be
breathed in (<a href="#angle-grinders">see Wood dust</a>).
- When the air is clear remove your mask.
- Store tool in a safe place away from children.


## **POWER DRILLS**


Drills are the most popular power tools. Most accidents occur when a drill bit slips or snaps, or when a bit is too blunt and requires heavier
pressure to make it do the job. Accidents also occur when the bit &#39;breaks through&#39; the material being drilled. ALWAYS switch off the drill
when changing bits.


There are many attachments for drills, but these are not recommended-especially circular saw and lathe attachments (these may cause overheating,
or damage the chuck bearings). It is advisable to buy specific power tools for specific jobs. Drills work best as DRILLS.


When drilling wood, avoid using too much pressure and ALWAYS prepare for the moment the drill breaks through the other side of the workpiece. A
cleaner exit hole&mdash;and a way of avoiding the &#39;surprise&#39;&mdash;is to have a piece of waste wood under the drilling site. You should
still feel when you have broken through to the other side.

Always anchor the workpiece-use clamps if possible-or use a drill stand, which gives you a lot more control.

When drilling metal, use toughened steel (high-speed steel/tungsten) bits. Work at slower speeds, despite the &#39;high-speed&#39; label on the
bits. Always drill a pilot hole. Keep the bit oiled. Wear eye protection and avoid the sharp hot swarf.


The only exception to the &#39;no-attachments-on drills&#39; rule&mdash;rotary and drum sanders (safer still with a variable speed drill). For
fine work, there&#39;s no substitute for hand finishing (unfortunately).

<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img073_001.jpg" />
</figure>

Choose a drill with a sturdy steadying handle and variable speeds. For finer control of vertical drilling, and safety, always use a drill stand.

<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img073_002.jpg" />
</figure>

Orbital (A) and belt (B) sanders generate a LOT of dust&mdash;ALWAYS wear a mask and goggles. Circular saws (C) and jigsaws (D) demand
concentration, especially at high speeds. ALWAYS switch off when changing blades.

<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img073_003.jpg" />

</figure>

Breaking through may be sudden and tear the metal. Always clamp a block of wood underneath the drill site to absorb the impact, or make a
&#39;sandwich&#39; of wood either side of the metal you wish to drill.


If drilling small pieces of metal, they MUST be anchored firmly&mdash;clamped or in a vice. Follow advice above to avoid the metal seizing the bit
and spinning round, possibly causing a severe injury to your hands.


You will need a full range of drill bits. There are types for&mdash;at least&mdash;wood, metal, glass and tiles. DON&#39;T believe that one set
will do all jobs&mdash;it won&#39;t.


### Choosing a drill


- Look for a drill with more than one speed. At slower speeds, the drill has more turning power (torque)&mdash;at higher speeds it produces
cleaner holes in wood.
- &#39;Hammer action&#39; is a useful option. You need it for drilling masonry, but read the instructions carefully and be sure to wear eye
protection.
- &#39;Reverse action&#39; can be a useful feature, especially at slow speeds for &#39;unscrewing&#39;.
- Hold the drill, feel its weight and balance. If other or additional handle options are available, try those too. At least one extra steadying
handle is a good idea.
- Lock-on buttons may NOT be a good idea, especially if placed where they could be activated by accident. Lock-OFF buttons are a better idea.


## **SANDERS**


The ONLY attachments recommended for power drills would be the simplest sanders. These are very useful when conventional sanders are too bulky to
do a job safely. But they are only as good as the drill they are attached to. A variable-speed drill would make them safer.


Rotary sanders consist of a circular rubber plate, to which you attach sandpaper discs, with a central shaft which is gripped by the drill chuck.
Avoid options with a metal backing plate which is almost as big as the rubber disc. These could be more dangerous. Rotary sanding discs should not
be used flat&mdash;they would be impossible to control&mdash;nor at too steep an angle, when they might &#39;run away with you&#39;.


Drum sanders are similar and should be used with equal care. In this case, a small plastic &#39;drum&#39; has a strip of sandpaper wrapped round
it.


Sanding tools generate a LOT of dust and debris, including grit particles from the sandpaper. You MUST wear eye and breathing protection (at
least)&mdash;wood dust is a long-term health hazard (<a href="#angle-grinders">see Wood dust</a>). There is also a fire/explosion risk from dust
in the air. Ventilate the work area&mdash;preferably have dust/debris collectors fitted directly to the tool&mdash;and an extractor fan.

DON&#39;T use sanders with wet waterproof sandpapers unless specifically recommended by the manufacturer.

### Belt sanders


There are numerous sizes available. Try the weight and see if you think you could manage to work with it. The belt will move at very high speed,
possibly taking you with it was swerving off into a cable or YOU. You will need both hands to operate it. Don&#39;t exert a lot of downward
pressure. The weight of the tool and the grade of sandpaper should do the work. Only buy a large belt sander if you intend to use it
professionally&mdash;these are better hired (large ones are called &#39;floor sanders&#39;).


Don&#39;t use a belt sander if you want a &#39;perfect finish&#39;-they are specifically for removing large amounts of material. The belt may
wander on the rollers. If worn too thin, or snagged on a nail, the belt may shred and foul the machine. A fitted dustcollection apparatus is
essential was are safety glasses and good breathing protection.

:::danger[Warning]


If you plug in a belt sander and it is switched on, it will &#39;run away&#39;. Never put it down or abandon it until the belt has totally
stopped moving.

:::

### Orbital sanders


Also called finishing sanders, the flat sanding pad moves in small circles&mdash;it does not rotate. The work is done by using various grades of
sandpaper&mdash;coarse for heavy smoothing, fine for light finishing&mdash;NOT by exerting downward pressure on the tool. This will not make the
sander more efficient, it will tear the paper, cause a lot of vibration and possibly overheat the motor. Orbital sanders can produce a better
finish than belt sanders. A fitted dust/debris collector is ESSENTIAL-as are safety glasses and adequate breathing protection.

:::danger[Warning]

Fitting new sanding papers can be very fiddly-NEVER do so when the machine is plugged in or switched on.
:::
:::info[SANDER PROBLEMS]


Mechanical sanders never quite get &#39;into&#39; corners&mdash;and don&#39;t produce perfect results without a lot of time and patience.
Flexes tend to be short. Assess whether this will be a problem before you start and use an extension lead (fully unwound) if necessary. If you
work at the top of a ladder, the extension socket may swing about in mid-air. Avoid this!


If you never intend to tackle large sanding jobs, consider using ordinary sandpaper (or, in some cases, steel wool) instead. If you only want
to sand paintwork for repainting, sugar soap, strong detergent or &#39;liquid sander&#39; (all used with care) could be a lot easier. Most
sanders will not cope with curved surfaces and wooden mouldings.

:::

## **SAWS**


### Jigsaws


Jigsaws cause a lot of vibration. The blade, which is exposed, moves up and down rapidly and&mdash;because most cut on the upstroke&mdash;throws
up a lot of debris. Some blow the dust away in front of themselves, so that you can see the cut line. You will find yourself leaning over and
peering closely, especially on finer work&mdash;and getting a faceful. You MUST wear eye and breathing protection.

NEVER put your hand or any other part of your body underneath the workpiece. The blade protrudes and could easily slice a finger at high speed.

There should be no need to exert much pressure&mdash;let the blade do the work. Gently guiding the saw should be enough, unless the blade is blunt
or unsuited to the type/thickness of material you are trying to cut. When you push, the blade twists or moves out of alignment, so the cut line
wanders and you risk breaking the blade. Jigsaws require a lot of concentration to follow a line accurately&mdash;especially at speed. Buy one
with variable speeds. You should work more slowly with plastics. Cutting metal requires the use of a lubricant.

:::tip[REMEMBER]


If the jigsaw has an adjustable sole plate for angled cuffing&mdash;take care. Always make sure the sole plate is well tightened in position.
Don&#39;t work too quickly&mdash;it&#39;s harder to control an angled cut. Let the blade stop moving before you put the jigsaw down.

:::
Only use the &#39;lock-on&#39; button if you really must-otherwise, if you have an accident, the saw will carry on working by itself.

Some jigsaws allow guides to be fitted, which enable you to follow the edge of a workpiece. These can help you control the tool. Never overreach,
but travel with the saw if you can.


### Blades


Blades must be chosen with care. You will find many kinds available. They vary greatly for hard and softwoods, plywoods, coarse or fine work,
metal, plastic, straight or curved cutting. Replace blades when they become worn&mdash;that means as soon as they demand more pressure to do the
job. A lot of heat is generated by friction and sawdust may smoulder or ignite. Unplug the tool BEFORE attempting to replace blades. A
screwdriver/Allen key is usually required to do the job. Make sure the new blade is well fixed in.


### Circular saw/power saw


Circular saws (also called power saws) are a lot more dangerous than jigsaws. Cutting is done, as the name suggests, by a circular blade. Much
care and concentration are required to maintain and use a circular saw.


Circular saws cut on the up stroke and guards should ALWAYS be fitted. NEVER operate a circular saw without a bladeguard AND another guard which
swings back as the cut is made (and moves back at the end of the cut). NEVER fix any guard in any position to &#39;get it out of the way&#39;.
NEVER put your hand or any other part of your body underneath the workpiece. The blade penetrates and could easily cut off your hand. Always wear
eye and breathing protection.


There is a variety of different blades available, for different jobs. Don&#39;t push the saw through the workpiece. If you feel you have to, the
blade may be blunt or incorrect for the material you are trying to cut. The blades must be sharpened by a professional.


Make sure the blade is well fixed. Let it reach full speed before starting to cut&mdash;and let it stop before lifting the saw away from the
workpiece.


NEVER NEVER NEVER touch the blade, or attempt to replace it, while the tool is plugged in. There should not be a lock-on button&mdash;if there is,
do NOT use it. NEVER. If an accident occurs, a runaway circular saw could do a lot of damage. If faced with a choice when buying, a lock-OFF
button is by far the safer option.

If you are left-handed, you may find using a circular saw difficult. With most models, it is hard to see the cutting line.
:::tip[REMEMBER]

With jigsaws and circular saws, it is easier to cut large sheet materials if you drape the flex over your shoulder.
:::

## **OTHER OPTIONS**


### Power planers


Use with great care. These machines eat wood! They also spew out a great quantity of debris. Always wear eye and breathing protection. Always try
to arrange debris collection at source with a collection bag, or vacuum cleaner attachment.


- Make sure NOT to connect the power while the tool is switched on.
- NEVER leave the tool resting in an upright position, resting on the blade. If it starts up, it may run away, possibly causing a serious
accident.
- NEVER switch on until in position to commence planing.
- NEVER put the tool down until the blades have finished rotating completely.
- NEVER rest the tool on the palm of your hand, or on your lap&mdash;this is an invitation to disaster.
- NEVER plane a piece of hand-held wood!
- ALWAYS clamp the workpiece, or use a vice.
- ALWAYS work on a clear firm surface.


The cylinder of blades can usually be sharpened, but may need to be replaced in some models. Don&#39;t expect to be able to plane nail and screw
heads.


NEVER NEVER NEVER touch or attempt to replace a blade while the tool is plugged in. The blade (in domestic models) revolves at up to 20,000
revolutions per minute&mdash;more than enough to inflict serious damage.


### Electric screwdrivers


Rechargeable, battery-operated and conventional versions are available. They are NOT magic screwdrivers, and all the safety rules for screwdrivers
apply&mdash;as do power-tool safety rules, in mains-operated versions. You are unlikely to have all the tip styles to suit all screw sizes and
types.


The turning force (torque) varies from model to model-but, unless you observe all the normal rules (drilling pilot holes, for example), you might
find that the electric screwdriver wants to turn in your hands while the screw stands still!


Power planers (A) need careful adjustment. Electrical screwdrivers (B) are only &#39;magic&#39; if you have drilled pilot holes. Angle grinders
(C) have many uses, but the larger ones tend to be unwieldy.

<figure class="text--center">
<img src="/images/img076_001.jpg"
/>

</figure>

NEVER work &#39;into&#39; your hand, but always on a firm surface. Don&#39;t work on your lap. Keep all parts of your body out of the way, in case
you slip.


### Angle grinders


These are the most recent tools to creep into the domestic market. Ranging from small specialist tools to large unwieldy professional (or hire
shop) models&mdash;they basically consist of a power tool which turns a circular grindstone at great speed.


Angle grinders create an enormous amount of debris and dust&mdash;guards should be fitted. Eye and breathing protection is essential. Damp down
the area which is to be worked&mdash;observing ALL the rules of electrical safety!


The basic function of an angle grinder (depending on size and power) is to grind away material. They may be used, for instance, for cutting
through plaster on walls, when &#39;letting in&#39; a new fireplace; for cutting paving slabs; for slicing through brick walls.


Larger models may have an almost &#39;gyroscopic effect (have you ever noticed the tendency of toy gyroscopes to find their own orientation when
turning quickly?) and may be hard to control. Get your balance! Be very careful if using up a ladder. Don&#39;t overreach.


Keep all parts of your body out of the way. Angle grinders are very dangerous and messy. They require a lot of concentration and, sometimes, a lot
of strength. Bad accidents on record make &#39;gory&#39; reading.

:::info[WOOD DUST]



This is VITAL information for anyone who works with wood. Wood dusts, surprisingly, pose severe hazards. They can cause, depending on the type
of wood, amount of exposure and the sensitivity of the individual: dermatitis, asthma, bronchitis, chronic lung diseases, lung fibrosis, eye
irritation, nasal and sinus irritation, and they have been linked with cancer.


There may be specific dangers from some woods. African boxwood in your system can cause you to feel tired and lose the ability to
concentrate-which could be very dangerous if operating machinery.


Wood oils and sap may be poisonous. Further hazards arise if the wood being worked on has been treated with preservatives, fungicides,
insecticides, waxes, oils, polishes, glues, shellac and varnishes. Even new timber may have been treated with the first three at the timber
yard.


Fungicides, for example, may be very toxic and have been linked&mdash;in addition&mdash;to anaemia and disorders of the central nervous system
and liver.


Heating of the wood while working may be a factor&mdash;sanding, sawing and planing all generate heat, which may alter the chemical nature of
wood dust or treatments that have been used on the wood.


Ventilation and dust extraction are VITAL. Breathing protection should NOT be taken lightly, nor should eye protection, barrier cream
and&mdash;when possible&mdash;gloves. Always wash or shower well after exposure. Avoid dry sweeping or using a vacuum cleaner, unless the
latter is specially designed for the job or the exhaust of a domestic model is not venting back into the work area. Small particles travel
straight through domestic vacuum cleaners. Damp down dust or use a damp mop instead.


Avoid any dust from (most) plywoods, chipboards, blockboards and particle boards. The resin/glue used to hold them together may release
FORMALDEHYDE&mdash;associated with headaches, &#39;persistent&#39; colds and coughs, asthma, depression, insomnia, dermatitis, and possible
links with cancers.


Nearly all woods have thus far been identified as requiring caution. The amount of exposure required to cause some of the more serious effects
is not clear. It should therefore be considered that there is no &#39;safe&#39; exposure level for inhalation. Even the most common woods (as
the following, by no means definitive, list shows) are known to have caused health problems.


Beech, birch, African boxwood, South American boxwood, red cedar, dogwood, ebony, greenheart, African mahogany, American mahogany, maple,
obeche, pine, ramin, redwood, Brazilian rosewood, Indian rosewood, satin wood, teak


Because of the devastation of tropical forests, more and more &#39;exotic woods&#39; are becoming readily available. Treat all with caution.


Fire/explosion risks should also always be considered with the presence of dense wood dust. It is very unwise to smoke, have naked flames or
create a lot of sparks in a heavily-dusty atmosphere. DON&#39;T take ventilation lightly. It could save your life.

:::

## **HIRE TOOLS**


The really determined do-it-yourself enthusiast may have occasional need for tools which are too expensive or too specialized to be worth buying
and trying to find storage space for. &#39;Hire&#39; shops will offer almost any equipment, from wallpaper strippers to spanners. Apart from the
dangers of unfamiliarity with larger tools, there is also the danger that&mdash;when hiring by the day or by the hour&mdash;you may be tempted to
hurry a job.

Plan the work and choose the tool very carefully. Try not to work alone. If an accident happens, you may need someone to raise the alarm.
ALL PREVIOUSLY STATED RULES FOR TOOLS APPLY.

### When hiring equipment


- Hire from a reputable dealer.
- DON&#39;T accept a heavier or more unwieldy machine than you feel you could cope with.
- CHECK the machine is complete, with all attachments.
- CHECK to see if special tools are required for making adjustments/fixing attachments.
- DON&#39;T accept machines which show any signs of slipshod repair work.
- Be wary of machines which have just been returned&mdash;and have not been &#39;checked over&#39;.
- Ask for clear instructions, safety advice AND a demonstration, if necessary.
- Make sure you have the correct protective gear.


### When using equipment


- Use the equipment exactly as instructed.
- Use the equipment only for the specific type of job it was intended to do.
- Don&#39;t over-exert yourself to get the job done quickly, because of the cost of hiring.
- Stop and check the equipment over for leaks, worn cables or loose connections from time to time.
- If the equipment sounds &#39;unhealthy&#39; or appears to be having difficulty, STOP. Contact the supplier.
- Don&#39;t be afraid to contact the supplier if you are the least bit unsure of the performance of the machine. Your safety is far more
important than what the person in the shop might think of you.
- Keep children and animals well away from the equipment&mdash;in fact, from the entire work area.
- Do not leave the equipment unattended for any length of time whatsoever.


## **CHAINSAWS**


A large petrol-driven chainsaw is possibly one of the most dangerous tools. In inexperienced hands, records prove that all manner of horrific
accidents are possible&mdash;but accidents can happen to anyone. DON&#39;T work alone. Expect the unexpected. DON&#39;T take chances. Avoid a
chainsaw &#39;massacre&#39;!

<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img077_003.jpg" />

</figure>

### Before you start


Ensure that children and animals are kept well away from the work area. You should have thick, not loose, clothing. Long hair should be tied back.
Steel-toe-capped boots are essential, as are thick well-fitting gloves. There are specially made reinforced gloves, which should be safer. There
are also limb and torso guards&mdash;some are designed to &#39;burst&#39; on impact, fouling the blade and stopping it. These may not be readily
available, but are worth investigating.

:::danger[Warning]


Under no circumstances consider using a chainsaw if you are tired, drunk or feeling ill. If the weather is very blustery or wet forget it.
DON&#39;T work alone.

:::

### Further protection


Both you and your assistant should have impact-resistant safety goggles and hearing protectors. Debris could be thrown a considerable distance.
Your assistant should be close enough to &#39;assist&#39; but not to get in the way. Try to keep them &#39;behind the blade&#39;&mdash;where you
are.


### Using the saw


Before starting the saw, check there is fuel in the tank and oil in the reservoir. If the weather is cold, you may need to use the
&#39;choke&#39;. Clear the area. Your assistant should stand well away.


When the engine is running, the blade should NOT run at idling speed. If it does&mdash;STOP. Consult the supplier, unless you know how to make the
adjustment. Check the chain brake. Apply it and open the throttle. The chain should not move. If it does&mdash;STOP. This might not be a simple
adjustment. Consult the supplier.


### Fuel safety


Before refilling the tank, you MUST allow the engine to cool down. It could very easily be hot enough to ignite petrol spilled onto it. Open the
cap slowly to release any &#39;pressure&#39;. A funnel should help you avoid spilling fuel. DO NOT SMOKE!


After refilling, ensure the cap is tight&mdash;vibration while working can loosen the fit and fuel may spill onto you unnoticed. Sparks may come
out of the exhaust and ignite the fuel.

Store spare fuel well away from the work area.

### When cutting


- Use the part of the blade nearer the engine, to give you more control. Working close to the tip is tiring, and you are risking KICKBACK (see
below).
- If you are sawing a long horizontal piece of wood, do so from above. Support on either side of the cut line, fairly close to it. If supports
are too far apart, the wood will &#39;droop&#39; as the cut is made&mdash;closing the cut and gripping the blade. This is extremely dangerous.
- ALWAYS cut from above&mdash;not from below or sideways.

:::danger[Warning]


KICKBACK: Using the tip of the saw is very dangerous indeed. This is when some of the most serious accidents have happened. It is impossible
to control the blade, which may &#39;lump away&#39; from the wood violently. You or your assistant may be seriously injured. The chain may
even break and fly off. NEVER work near the tip of the blade. Allow free space around it at all times. DON&#39;T bring the tip down to touch
the ground. DON&#39;T attempt to &#39;pierce&#39; with the blade.

:::

### Tree felling


It is impossible to give directions for coping with every possible variation of tree work. Accidents are numerous&mdash;both from the saw and from
heavy branches falling unexpectedly. Tree felling/pruning may look easy and, to some people it seems to be quite exciting&mdash;but do NOT attempt
it unless you know what you are doing.

:::info[SAFETY RULES]
- NEVER walk about with the blade moving&mdash;or even with the motor running. If you trip, the brake may disengage
- DON&#39;T strain when using the saw. DON&#39;T do anything that feels awkward
- DON&#39;T cut above your waist height. NEVER at shoulder height. NEVER above your head
- DON&#39;T work up a ladder&mdash;even on trees. Professional tree cutters know what they&#39;re doing and use harnesses, ropes and
winches&mdash;they don&#39;t just cut off branches and &#39;see what happens&#39;
- DON&#39;T set a hot saw down where a fire could start
- DON&#39;T work in a tight space&mdash;have room for movement
- Plan your &#39;escape route&#39;. If an accident happens, you may have to jettison the saw. Keep a space in mind for this, and keep your
assistant out of the &#39;line of fire&#39;

- Only cut wood with the saw
- NEVER cut into the ground
- BEWARE of nails in timber?
- ALWAYS disconnect the spark-plug lead if attempting to clean or adjust the blade
- The saw should do the work. Don&#39;t force it. If you have to use excessive pressure, the blade may be blunt. STOP
- Don&#39;t work in amongst brush and twigs which may prevent you using the saw safely&mdash;and being able to operate safety devices
- The chain should not be loose. If it is&mdash;STOP

:::

If pruning, you may kill a tree by leaving gaping wounds for diseases and rot to set in. The tree may become dangerous in later years.

If the tree is within 10m (33ft) of a house, it may be affecting the foundations. Removal of the tree can also cause damage, although the effects
may not be apparent for a few years. Consult a specialist.


## SOLDERING/BRAZING


Most domestic soldering consists of making small joins in electrical work, using small soldering irons, or making soldered (capillary) joints for
plumbing. A larger soldering iron or a propane torch may be hired for joining sheet metal. There are obvious dangers from the heat-burns and fires
are a constant risk&mdash;but the materials involved are also highly toxic. Good ventilation is essential to avoid breathing fumes. When judging
the fire hazard, typical temperatures involved in ordinary soldering with tin-and-lead solder are 175-250&deg;C (347-482&deg;F), while brazing
(which tends to use copper-and-zinc solder) requires temperatures of 700-900&deg;C (1292-1652&deg;F).


### Solders


Most solders contain a combination of potentially toxic metals. Brass, copper, lead, zinc, tin and pewter are common. Do not handle excessively.
NEVER inhale the fumes of molten solder.


### Fluxes


Fluxes, which allow the solder to flow, are intended to &#39;cut through&#39; oxides on the metal to make a good firm join. They are poisonous and
corrosive. Do NOT breathe the fumes they produce. Wear barrier cream or disposable gloves. If any flux does get on your skin&mdash;use a good skin
cleanser. The flux for brazing is usually a borax paste&mdash;which is often the main constituent of ant-killer! Enough said.


## WELDING


Welding is only required if a strong join is needed. It&#39;s really a job for professionals, but many people hire welding equipment for repairs
to cars, gates and grilles. It isn&#39;t something you do well the first time you try and great risks are involved.


Solders are not usually employed&mdash;instead, the point of contact between two metal surfaces (usually steel-to-steel or aluminium-to-aluminium)
is heated until they &#39;melt together&#39;. Extra metal&mdash;a filler&mdash;may be melted into or onto the joint.


You need a lot of concentration and a lot of control. Welds go wrong in lots of ways. DON&#39;T rely on a welded joint (for example, on a car or a
child&#39;s swing) unless you know what you are doing. If the temperature is too high, you may melt too much metal or make a hole. Too low and the
join might break. Take a class in welding to give you an idea of what&#39;s involved.


### Gas welding


Gas welding involves cylinders of oxygen and acetylene, which are mixed within a torch. In some cases, butane or propane are mixed with oxygen
instead. Great care must be taken with all the cylinders. They should NEVER be handled or stored carelessly. DON&#39;T knock or tamper with the
valves or gauges.

:::warning[EMERGENCY]
HOT ACETYLENE CYLINDER

![ ](/images/img079_001.jpg)

- If the acetylene cylinder is exposed to heat <br />
Take outside as quickly/carefully as possible

- Close the valve tightly <br />
Take off regulator <br />
Cool the cylinder with water



WHEN IT HAS COOLED DOWN <br />
Open the valve and release all the gas


IF UNCERTAIN <br />
Move the cylinder to a people-free area, cool it <br />
Call the fire brigade for advice.

:::
In practice, acetylene is always lit BEFORE the oxygen is turned on. And don&#39;t forget:

- Do not use too great a flame.
- Don&#39;t touch the flame, it is extremely hot.
- Don&#39;t point the flame at anyone or anything apart from the workpiece itself.
- Clamp all work firmly in position.
- Wear safety gear&mdash;this is VITAL.
- Try to avoid having any part of your body beneath the weld site&mdash;molten metal may fall on you.
- Keep the hoses AWAY from the heat.

:::danger[Warning]


Oxygen: Fires will start and burn more easily in oxygen-rich air. Never smoke, make sparks or use a naked flame near stored cylinders.
Acetylene: It is very flammable. It can react with some metals to produce an explosion. Never replace any of the fittings on the cylinder or
improvize connections on hoses or torch. If an acetylene cylinder is exposed to heat follow the emergency steps above.

:::
:::info[CYLINDER SAFETY]


- Handle cylinders with great care
- Store cylinders away from dust and debris, which might prevent a valve from closing properly
- Clean all threads&mdash;but do NOT grease them or use a jointing compound before making connections
- Don&#39;t allow children anywhere near the cylinders
- Avoid long hoses&mdash;there is more of them to be damaged
- Blue hoses should be used for oxygen, red for acetylene
- NEVER attempt to mix two or more gases in a cylinder&mdash;or to transfer gas from one cylinder to another
- Acetylene must be stored UPRIGHT
- Don&#39;t subject cylinders to extreme temperatures&mdash;hot or cold. Keep out of sunlight. DON&#39;T smoke/have naked flames near
cylinder


:::

### Arc welding


Although &#39;arc&#39; welders commonly plug into a 13-amp socket, a transformer reduces the voltages BUT steps up the rate of flow of the current
(amps) to a point when an intense spark or &#39;arc&#39; may be formed. The immense local heat causes two metal surfaces to fuse together.


The transformer has two leads (apart from the mains lead)&mdash;one is attached to the electrode holder which you use to make the weld, the other
is the earth connection which completes the circuit. The latter must be attached to the workpiece.


An arc is formed when you touch the electrode holder to the workpiece, great heat is generated and the tip of the electrode melts and flows into
the joint. You MUST observe all instructions on earthing equipment and insulation.


### Safety gear


Welding produces intense light and you will need a whole-face visor which is filtered to protect your skin&mdash;AND YOUR SIGHT. Apart from
visible light, infra-red and ultra-violet are produced. These can cause severe eye burn, deep sunburn, skin &#39;cancers&#39; and headaches.


You should cover as much skin as possible&mdash;with clothing which does not let light through. Wear several layers. Professional welders use
leather aprons and gauntlets. Greasy clothes increase the risk of fire. Don&#39;t wear man-made fibres. They may melt. Heavy boots are also needed
to avoid burns from droplets of molten metal.

Ventilate the area well and use breathing protection. The fumes which are produced during welding are poisonous-often extremely so.

## **PAINT**


One of the simplest DIY jobs that many people undertake is decorating their own home. At least, it always LOOKS simple when other people do it?
Like any job you do around the home, it won&#39;t look any good if you don&#39;t prepare well beforehand and address any problems before you
start. You need to plan the work, estimate the cost of and buy materials&mdash;and be sure you have a good strong stepladder before starting.
NEVER balance on chairs, stools or boxes.

:::danger[Warning]


Many of the chemicals with which you will come into close contact may be toxic. Stripping paint is a hazardous process- however you do it.
Rubbing down old paint may be particularly hazardous-many old paints contained lead. Lead was still used as an additive in paints into the
1980s. In some countries, lead may still be used. Protect your skin and wear a facemask. Wash well alter exposure-lead is very toxic. NEVER
rub down any surface you suspect is made of or contains asbestos. Wallboards and insulating/fireproof panels may be asbestos sheet. Even
textured wall and ceiling coatings used to contain it (see SAFE AS HOUSES?: Asbestos).

:::

### Emulsion paint


Most (water-based) emulsion paints for domestic use have fairly low toxicity. Lead is no longer used as an additive (in most countries). DON&#39;T
use any paint you suspect of containing lead, especially where children may come into contact with the painted surface. DON&#39;T buy
&#39;cheap&#39; paints that do not have a recognized brand name. Be wary of bright-coloured paints- they may contain all sorts of additives. See
if the instructions give a hint as to their toxicity.

All paints you use should either state that they are NON-TOXIC, or clearly state any recommended precautions that you must take.

Ensure good ventilation while painting, while the paint is drying-and for a couple of days afterwards. Don&#39;t sleep in a newly-painted room for
a night or so. In warmer months, paint dries a lot faster&mdash;and ventilation is easier.


Some people are more sensitive to paint fumes (even from emulsion paint), and should take extra care to ensure good ventilation. Skin contact
should be avoided.

Paints containing fungicide are toxic. It may NOT be essential for you to use such a paint, unless you have a problem with damp or mould.

### &#39;Gloss&#39; paints


Gloss and other off-based paints contain solvents, which are poisonous. Gloves should be worn&mdash;and a mask. You should not smoke or use naked
flames around solvents, nor around these paints until they are dry. Ventilation is vital. Children or pets may be much more susceptible to the
effects of the fumes.


If you feel dizzy or nauseous, you are not ensuring a good supply of clean air. Open doors and windows to the room and go outside until you feel
better.


### Paint accidents


If you get any sort of paint at all on your skin, wash it off at once. This is easy with emulsion, if you don&#39;t wait. With gloss, or other
oil/solvent-based paints, wipe away any excess at once&mdash;without spreading it further. Use a household detergent (washing-up liquid would do),
without water at first. Rub this into the paint to dissolve it and rinse well with warm water. Hot water will open the pores of the skin, and may
force the paint to dry faster and become sticky. If possible, buy a good skin cleaner before you start painting. DON&#39;T use paint thinners,
white spirit, turps, petrol or any &#39;solvent&#39; on your skin.


Wear gloves and cover up other parts of your body as protection from splashes. Safety glasses should also be considered when painting ceilings or
using a roller.


If you get ANY paint in your eyes, wash them with cool running water for at least ten minutes, holding the lids open. Either hold your head under
a fairly low pressure flow from a shower hose or put your head under a tap. If neither of these is possible, splash the eye for several minutes
with water from a bowl. If there is any soreness, seek medical attention.


### Paint spraying


There are two main types of spray equipment, which you may not choose to own, but which are readily available from hire shops. One involves an air
compressor, which forces out paint droplets in a jet of air. The other forces the paint itself out under great pressure.


AVOID breathing paint mist or fumes&mdash;wear goggles and a very efficient face mask. Cover as much skin as possible. Ensure very good
ventilation. Do NOT spray indoors, if possible. If you must, open doors and windows to let the air circulate. An extractor fan would be a good
idea.

There is a high risk of fire and explosion&mdash;do NOT smoke or use naked flames PARTICULARLY if using oil/solvent-based paints.
:::danger[Warning]


NEVER leave equipment where a child could get at it. NEVER aim the gun at any part of your body-or at anyone else. The paint in
&#39;airless&#39; guns is sprayed at such a pressure that it can penetrate skin and surface tissues. NEVER touch the nozzle while paint is
being sprayed-on either sort of equipment. If there is a safety shield, do NOT remove it.


If you inject paint under the skin, seek medical attention at once. Explain the injury and supply all known details about the paint involved.
Disconnect the machine from the mains before attempting to clear a blocked nozzle.


Aerosol cans of paint are also to be used with extreme caution-even when just doing small touch-up jobs on your car. Always wear gloves and a
mask-and make sure that you don&#39;t work in a confined space.

:::
:::info[PRIMERS/SPECIAL PAINTS]


The only exception to the &#39;no-lead-in-paint&#39; rule is calcium plumbate primer&mdash;no efficient alternative has been found for
galvanized metal. Remember that lead is highly toxic and take great precautions to avoid exposing yourself to this risk. Never use calcium
plumbate primer indoors. Avoid hand-to-mouth contact (don&#39;t smoke, eat or drink while using). Wear a mask and cover all skin. Don&#39;t
breathe the fumes. If a large area of painting must be done, seek professional advice.


Many special primers contain aluminium or zinc&mdash;both of which are toxic in concentration&mdash;but are safer than any primer containing
lead.


Bitumen paints for roofs and external metalwork, and creosote (commonly used as a preservative on fences and outbuildings) are poisonous. Skin
contact and inhalation of the fumes should be avoided. Dermatitis (slight to severe skin irritation) is fairly certain and links are being
investigated between coal tar derivatives and cancer. Two constituents are known carcinogens-chrysene and benzo-a-pyrene.

:::
:::danger[Warning]


If a child swallows any paint, do not induce vomiting-especially with oil/solvent-based paints. If the child has swallowed emulsion paint
(without fungicide) give them a glass of water to drink slowly. See how the child feels after half an hour. If the child has swallowed a small
amount of paint containing fungicide or a large amount of any emulsion paint, seek medical attention. If any amount of oil/solvent-based
paints is swallowed, seek medical attention.

### Stripping paint


Stripping paint used to be a chore. Now it is a booming industry and even a major hobby&mdash;although the &#39;stripper&#39; tends to find out
pretty quickly that it is basically still a chore! Large jobs tend to get messier and messier and more and more boring-and people get careless,
trying to get the job finished.


If you have decided to become a &#39;stripper&#39;, you have two main alternatives: to heat the paint with a blow-torch (or blowlamp) or hot-air
stripper and scrape it away, or to use a paint-dissolving chemical stripper. Both have many hazards.


The likelihood, if you want a plain wooden finish, is that-having used heat&mdash;you will need a chemical stripper to clean the remains of the
paint from the wood. If you are repainting, sanding would probably be adequate.

A hot-air stripper is more controllable than a blow-torch but don&#39;t underestimate the heat it can produce.

### Hot-air strippers


Heating only really works with &#39;gloss&#39; or oil-based paints&mdash;not on cellulose (car) paints or emulsion paints. It is only really
suitable for wood&mdash;not metal or plastic. You have to heat the paint until it bubbles (not burns) and scrape it off fairly rapidly before it
goes hard and &#39;cooks&#39;.


A hot-air stripper is fairly easy to use. It works (basically) like a super-powered hairdryer&mdash;but is also quite dangerous. No hot stripping
is easy near glass&mdash;the glass will break&mdash;and special shields must be used. A variable heat control on a hot-air stripper would give you
more control. Whichever method you use, keep the heat source moving to prevent burning.


Keep a special clear area for &#39;resting&#39; the hot lamp/torch/ stripper when you are not using it. Keep some water handy in case a fire
starts. Work in a well-ventilated area (see WARNING below) and wear a mask and goggles. Don&#39;t wear rubber or plastic gloves which may melt
onto the skin.


If working outdoors, stop if conditions become windy&mdash;the heat would not be directable. Avoid cracks and crevices around door and window
flames and working under the eaves of your house&mdash;a fire may start very easily. It may be very difficult to reach it to put it out. As the
debris falls it is smouldering-damp it down every few minutes with a water spray.


### Clearing up


DON&#39;T run a bare hand over a partially-stripped area or collect debris without gloves. Some of the fragments, when cooled and hardened, can be
razor sharp. Wear breathing protection and gloves. Dispose of all debris carefully. Don&#39;t burn it&mdash;more fumes will be given off.

:::danger[Warning]


Older paints are very likely to contain lead, which is extremely toxic. Do not breathe fumes. Wear eye and breathing protection and keep skin
covered up.


Old textured paint-even only a few years old-may contain asbestos, which is highly dangerous if inhaled. Special chemical strippers claim to
be safe for the job, but seek professional advice before tackling removal.

:::

### Chemical strippers


There are several kinds of chemical stripper&mdash;most are messy, all are poisonous and will burn the skin quite badly. Most produce fumes which
are toxic, and make you feel dizzy or nauseous.


It&#39;s basically a question of applying the stripper, leaving it a while to do its job and scraping it off again. This often has to be done
several times to completely remove all paint. If you wait too long, the solvent (or moisture, in some types) evaporates and the job becomes much
harder.


Good ventilation is ESSENTIAL&mdash;as are eye/breathing/ hand protection. Thick plastic gloves are fine, but will gradually dissolve. If they
start to leak, replace them. Cover up as much skin as possible and try to work in a very controlled way&mdash;DON&#39;T slosh the stuff about.


If any chemical touches your skin, wash it off with water at once. If you don&#39;t, you will very quickly feel what the chemical can do. Very
painful burns are possible. If ANY of the chemical goes in your eyes, flush with cool running water for at least ten minutes&mdash;with the lids
held open. Seek medical attention.


Paste strippers, which you mix with water, often come in powder form. DO NOT INHALE! Wear a mask when mixing. These strippers are usually based on
caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) which will dissolve skin very efficiently.


The grain of the wood may &#39;lift&#39; with water-based paste strippers and &#39;water-washable&#39; liquid strippers if water is used as a
final rinse. When sanding, avoid the dust which will contain residual chemicals. Cover your skin, and wear gloves, a mask and goggles.


There are aerosol liquid strippers which&mdash;even if discontinued&mdash;may still be found on some dealers&#39; shelves. Somehow, the idea of
spraying a highly toxic, highly caustic substance does not seem safe or intelligent.

If you don&#39;t have a lot of energy or patience&mdash;DON&#39;T attempt the large-scale removal of paint. Call a specialist!

## **CRAFTS**


There are a number of crafts that are enjoyed at home, sometimes as business ventures&mdash;many involve dangerous tools, processes, materials and
chemicals that require careful handling and storage. Businesses must meet legal standards of workplace safety. The same precautions are VITAL at
home.

:::info[CHILDPROOFING]


Instruct children in the dangers of crafts processes and materials. Exclude them from the work area, if possible securing and locking it when
not in use, lest they attempt to &#39;have a go&#39; themselves.

:::

### Photography


Keen photographers will probably want to do their own processing and printing. If you use the bathroom as a darkroom make sure that you always
clear everything away afterwards. If you have a proper darkroom make it lockable. The deeper you get into processing the more chemicals you will
need.


Experiment with different types of tongs and plastic gloves to find the best way of avoiding contact with chemicals. Barrier creams may leave
fingerprints on film or paper.


- NEVER be casual about mixing or storing chemicals.
- AVOID skin contact with any chemical-even if you think it is harmless. Once you start putting your fingers in the baths for developer, stop
and fix, you will find it very difficult to get out of the habit. You may suffer from dermatitis straight away or develop sensitivity later
on.
- AVOID inhaling chemical powder, which is easily carried in the air. This is when chemicals are at their strongest. Wear a face mask. Fit an
extractor fan.
- AVOID hand-to-mouth contact. Don&#39;t smoke, eat or drink in the darkroom.
- NEVER raise bottles to your face to sniff the contents. The smell of some chemicals will knock you over&mdash;especially concentrated acetic
acid &#39;stop&#39; solution.
- DON&#39;T empty any chemicals down the sink. Contact the manufacturer or dealer regarding safe disposal.
- REMEMBER you are working with a potentially fatal combination of electricity and water.


### Ceramics


Whether in a pottery class or a home studio, it is very easy for the person involved in their craft to ignore the dangers from chemical glazes and
from the heat of the kiln in which pots are fired. Most potters seem very casual about clay dust where they work. The dust is loaded with silica
which can lodge in the lungs causing silicosis, a debilitating lung disease.


Many glazes are toxic, some very toxic, with lead and cadmium compounds common along with other dangerous metals. Some release poisonous fumes
when fired.


Regularly inspect the equipment you use. Check electric wheels and kilns for safety and the flues of gas kilns. Is the pugmill safe? When pushing
clay into it can you reach the screw? One day you may find out the hard way that you should not have removed the guards.


- NEVER breathe in particles of clay or glazes. Wear a mask&mdash;especially when spraying glazes.
- Instal an efficient extractor fan and ensure good ventilation in the workplace.
- DAMP DOWN DUST and clear up with a mop. DON&#39;T use a dry brush (it stirs up the dust), or a vacuum cleaner&mdash; hazardous particles pass
straight through!
- Clearly label ALL materials.

:::danger[Warning]

Some glazes are unsuitable for tableware since they are never completely stable. Poisonous particles may be swallowed.
:::

### Other crafts


Hobbyists are taking up a wide range of home crafts. At one time, if not getting poisoned by substances such as oxalic acid in chemistry sets, the
main danger seemed to be the inhalation of polystyrene cement while making up plastic model kits. Today both the range of activities and our
knowledge of their risks has increased.


Accidents and illnesses can be avoided if you know the risks involved before you take up a craft. Most manufacturers and dealers should be helpful
in warning of the dangers of equipment and materials&mdash;but also seek expert tuition and advice in craft processes.


Casting miniature figures in &#39;white metal&#39; is one of the new popular hobbies which carries severe risks from fumes and carbon
monoxide&mdash;as well as the danger of serious deep burns from molten metal. Some reusable mould-making compounds release formaldehyde vapour,
which is highly toxic (<a href="/topicid-992#solvents-in-the-home">see POISONS: Formaldehyde</a>). Silicon is a very common ingredient of
mould-making &#39;rubber&#39; and mould-release agents.


Enamelling carries high risk of burns and exposure to toxic fumes as powdered mixtures of ground glass and chemicals are deposited on to pieces of
copper and fired at a high temperature. There are grave dangers of inhalation and ingestion of powder &#39;enamels&#39;. Small kilns may have been
insulated with asbestos&mdash;itself very dangerous. Be aware of the risks (<a href="./urban-safety-first#asbestos">see SAFETY FIRST: Asbestos</a>.)


Stained-glass work uses lead, which is a dangerous, cumulative poison, and glass which can splinter unexpectedly and cut. Cuts will aid the entry
of lead into the blood system. Flash-coloured glass usually has a thin layer of colour applied to one side&mdash;the side you cut. As the cutter
runs over the surface, tiny fragments of glass fly up. As you lean in to concentrate on the work, eye protection is essential&mdash;as are thick
gloves when straightening and stretching the lead cames.


Large amounts of solder and flux are used to join the work together&mdash;avoid inhaling the fumes they give off when heated. Individual sections
of glass may be etched with acids or treated with chemicals, glass powders and oxides which are applied in solution and fired on. All need careful
handling.

:::info[ARTISTS&#39; PAINTS]


Paints used by artists, designers and illustrators are NOT for use by children, who should be given non-toxic play paints instead. Check that
these play paints ARE non-toxic.


Lead, mercury, arsenic, barium, manganese, cobalt, chromium, cadmium, titanium and antimony all frequently occur as compounds in artists&#39;
paints. Never lick your brushes-even to &#39;put a point on them&#39;. Avoid excessive skin contact. If mixing dry pigment, also avoid
inhalation.


Using &#39;airbrushes&#39; or spray guns increases the risk greatly. Wear a dust mask and ensure good ventilation. There is also a
fire/explosion risk if the air becomes heavily dust-laden&mdash;increased immensely if a solvent is involved.


Avoid hand-to-mouth contact. Don&#39;t mix eating or smoking with painting. The danger is great&mdash;after years of using artists&#39;
materials, the user may become casual about the dangers. Several of the toxic substances are cumulative poisons (in other words they build up
in your system), many are carcinogenic (cancer causing), and by the time any serious effects come to light, it may be too late.

:::
:::tip[REMEMBER]


If you currently enjoy or are thinking of taking up a craft, read all you can about it to discover the associated hazards&mdash;there are many
other potentially dangerous crafts processes in addition to the examples given here. Enrol in classes before launching into a new activity. It
will give you a chance to see whether it really interests you&mdash;and to learn about safety rules before taking unknown risks.

:::

## **LADDERS**


Most accidents in the home are caused by falls. Whenever you have to work above a comfortable height, you need something to stand on. DON&#39;T
use chairs, stools or boxes. They could tip over&mdash;and there is nothing to hold on to. NEVER make a pile of furniture or boxes to stand on.


Every home should have a simple set of steps&mdash;a small stool/steps combination will probably be enough for a kitchen. Make sure it has
non-slip feet and is strong enough to take your weight. Never stand on the top step with both feet, unless there is a rail to hold onto. Never
stand the stool/ steps on anything to increase the working height.


### Stepladders


You should have a small, lightweight, aluminium stepladder, with a safety bar/handrail at the top to hold onto and good locks&mdash;to stop the
ladder folding up or splaying its legs when you are on it. The treads should be wide enough to be comfortable.


Don&#39;t go for the biggest set of steps if you don&#39;t really need them. Carrying them through the house could be difficult and dangerous.
There are other points to consider:

- Are the feet of the stepladder non-slip?
- Try the ladder in the shop. Feel the weight-can you carry it easily? Can you put it up and collapse it easily? Does it have locks? Does it
look/feel strong enough? Are there sharp edges or places where fingers could be pinched?


If you need to get in and out of a loft, there are extendible (two-way) &#39;stepladders&#39; which could double as loft ladders. The best course
of action would be to fit a special loft ladder which is always there, but folds up out of sight.


There are various two- and three-way convertible aluminium ladders which hinge in various directions. Before conversion, it may be a stepladder.
Undoing locks and raising one side of the ladder will form a straight ladder.


### Extension ladders


Most ladders are made of wood or aluminium. Aluminium is lighter, won&#39;t rot and is generally less of a problem. The length of the ladder you
need depends on how high you need to work and how much room you have to store the ladder when not in use. Ladders can be hired quite economically,
which widens the range of choice considerably.


Working up ladders is neither as comfortable, nor as safe as working on a platform tower&mdash;but you may have no choice if there is no room to
erect a tower.


Most extension ladders are in two separate sections (sometimes three) and extend to a &#39;safe&#39; working length of about 67m
(19-22ft)&mdash;&#39;safe&#39; because there must always be an overlap between the sections when working. You will need a ladder to be at least 1m
(over 3ft) longer than the highest point you need to reach. Always anchor it at the top for extra safety.


### Using an extension ladder


If you feel nervous working off the ground, and this feeling does not pass, STOP. Not everyone is comfortable with heights. There is nothing
&#39;sissy&#39; about this. Working at a height is a very risky business&mdash;there are many deaths and injuries associated with using ladders.


NEVER rest the ladder on very uneven or very soft ground. If the feet seem likely to slip, DON&#39;T climb the ladder. On uneven ground you may
have to block up the feet, unless they are adjustable, and anchor the ladder top and bottom before climbing. On soft ground, rest the feet on a
strong board to spread the weight. Bang pegs into the ground to stop the board slipping and anchor the ladder top and bottom. ALWAYS have someone
working with you, in order to:


- Hold onto the ladder, with one foot on the bottom rung to steady it
- Get help if an accident occurs


NEVER lean sideways off a ladder&mdash;move the ladder so you can reach. NEVER climb higher than the fifth rung from the top&mdash;you need some
ladder to hold onto.

:::tip[REMEMBER]


Use the rule of threes: Of your two hands and two feet, three points of contact should always be made. Either both feet and one hand should be
in contact&mdash;or both hands and one foot. Professional climbers always use this rule to avoid risk-taking and accidents.

:::

### While working


- Wipe mud off your feet BEFORE you climb the ladder.
- When working, have BOTH feet on one rung and spread your weight evenly.
- Lean against the ladder with your legs, keeping your free hand behind the ladder, holding a RUNG.
- DON&#39;T hold onto the side of the ladder, if you slip, your grip won&#39;t hold.
- DON&#39;T lean the ladder against guttering&mdash;this is dangerous. If necessary, use a stand-off. This is a small frame which holds the
ladder away from the wall at the top.
- If working in one location, tie the ladder to pegs driven into the ground.
- ALWAYS anchor the top of the ladder to stop it slipping. Tie it to a fixed/stable part of the building, through a window to an immovable
object or to a batten across the inside of the window frame.
- If you need to rest the top of the ladder exactly where a window is, tie a strong batten or stout plank across the top of the ladder to rest
the load either side of the window.


:::tip[REMEMBER]


- Check ladders regularly for signs of wear and tear
- Never use a ladder as a bridge, laid down to walk on
- Never use a wooden ladder if you suspect rot
- Never leave a ladder unattended outside. Children and burglars are quite fond of them
- Lock the ladder away when not in use-or chain to a stout tree or fixed post
- Never work up a ladder in high winds
- Never allow more than one person on a ladder at a time
- Never ascend or descend a ladder with your back to it
- Don&#39;t climb if you are drunk, tired or feeling ill
- NEVER position a ladder in a doorway

:::
:::info[CARRYING TOOLS]


DON&#39;T carry tools in your hand, your pockets or slung about your body on hooks or straps. They could cause a serious injury if you fall.
Instead, carry tools up in a shoulder bag, which you could jettison, and hang it on a hook when you reach working height. DON&#39;T drop tools
to the ground when you&#39;ve finished with them!

:::
:::danger[Warning]


NEVER use a power tool with the lock-on button pressed. If you fall, or drop the tool, it may curry on working-and cause a more serious
accident.

:::

### Carrying a ladder


Everyone tells you to carry a ladder vertically. That is easier said than done with a long ladder. It takes a lot of nerve, control and practice.
If you can&#39;t manage this circus trick, don&#39;t despair. Two people can wrestle a long ladder into almost any position, better than one.

:::danger[Warning]


Always use a ladder at an angle of 75&deg;. The distance between the base of the ladder and the wall should be one quarter the height of the
uppermost point of contact.

:::

### Accessories


Look for ladder accessories which can make working at a height easier and safer. There are bolt-on or clip-on platforms which can make the rung
you stand on into a wider &#39;perch&#39;. Stand-offs hold the top of the ladder away from the wall so you can avoid resting the ladder on
guttering. A clip-on tray would make a good area for resting tools or paint while you work. A pot of paint could be easier to manage if slung from
a rung on a large S-shaped hook.


### When NOT to use a ladder


DON&#39;T use a ladder if you feel unsafe or at all worried about the height. DON&#39;T use a ladder if you will need both hands to do a job.
DON&#39;T use a ladder for climbing onto a roof&mdash;nearly all roof coverings are unsafe and liable to be damaged in the process. DON&#39;T use
a ladder for major jobs like taking down a chimney stack.

In all these cases, call a professional&mdash;who may choose to erect proper scaffolding&mdash;or consider using a platform tower.

## **PLATFORM TOWERS**


Platform towers are safer, by far, than using extension ladders. You need space at ground level for one to stand safely. They are probably too
costly and too bulky in storage to make it worth buying one-but they may be hired.


The towers are, basically, in &#39;kit form&#39;-consisting of H-frames which slot together. Each level is added at right angles to the previous
one&mdash;with occasional diagonal braces dropped in for stability. At the top are placed standing boards and&mdash;very important-a hand rail.

Platform towers can be built single-handed, with a rope to haul the sections up, but really require at least two people.

When built, the towers resemble some children&#39;s climbing frames. NEVER let a child play on or near the tower. NEVER leave a tower unattended.


### Working safely

The top of the tower should be at a safe working height for the job you need to do. NEVER use a ladder on top of a tower.

The height of the tower should not be greater than three times the base dimension. Square towers are safer than oblong ones, where the height
should not exceed the SMALLER of the base dimensions. External supports&mdash;outriggers&mdash;increase the working height to three times the
resulting base.


Towers MUST be built on level ground&mdash;choose the feet to suit the quality of the support the ground offers. On soft ground, you need base
plates to spread the load and prevent sinking. On very level ground, &#39;castors&#39; (which MUST be locked before the tower is climbed) allow
the tower to be moved from one location to another&mdash;avoiding dismantling.


There are &#39;adjustable&#39; feet which allow you to compensate for slightly uneven ground&mdash;or if it is absolutely essential to build the
tower on steps. ALWAYS level the first section, before commencing to build the tower.

:::tip[REMEMBER]


Always climb inside the frame. Haul a bag of tools up separately, with a rope&mdash;you must have both hands free for climbing. Make sure you
wipe any mud off your feet BEFORE you climb.

:::

### Safety first


- ALWAYS secure the tower at the top, to prevent toppling.
- NEVER rest a ladder against a tower-or only do so IF the top of the tower is secured and IF the ladder is leaning towards the building. ALWAYS
secure the ladder top and bottom, before attempting to climb it.
- Fix the top boards, or remove them if you expect high winds. It is fairly possible that they may be dislodged by the wind&mdash;and do
considerable damage.


:::danger[Warning]


Do NOT attempt roof work it you are not qualified to do so. NEVER walk on a roof! Quite apart from the damage you will do to the roof-no roof
covering is intended for walking on-most roofs are not strong enough. The use of crawlboards and roof &#39;ladders&#39; is ESSENTIAL.
Innumerable deaths and accidents have been caused by people thinking that it was safe to walk about on roofs, because they&#39;ve seen
&#39;professionals&#39; doing so. You must seek specialist advice.

:::

## **PROTECTIVE CLOTHING**



With almost all DIY processes, some form of physical protection is required. Skin may heal if superficially burned by chemicals&mdash;but body
functions such as sight, hearing and breathing should not be viewed as renewable resources.


Safety equipment on sale may NOT be safe enough-safety goggles may not be shatterproof, breathing masks may be hopelessly inefficient. Always
choose, not by price, but by evidence that the items have passed tests for efficiency and durability.

There is no reason why protection during amateur work should be any less effective than that used by professionals or in industry.

### The basics


Tough overalls are essential for most kinds of work&mdash;not to stop you ruining your clothes, but so that dust and contamination is confined to
one set of clothes and not carried around with you. A lab coat or apron, or a separate set of &#39;work&#39; clothes may suffice for cleaner safer
jobs.


Overalls should fit OVER another set of clothes and be roomy enough to allow for movement&mdash;such as bending down or reaching your arms above
your head. They should not be loose enough to catch in machinery, particularly the sleeves. A buttoned cuff is probably safer than a plain one.

The fabric should be tightly woven and flameproof. Some man-made fibres may melt onto the skin when heat is applied.
Wash overalls separately from general laundry.

Investigate overalls with removable limb or torso guards&mdash;some of which are designed to protect you (to some degree) from the impact of a
revolving cutting blade.


### Gloves


The gloves you wear must not prevent you from working safely&mdash;they should fit but should not be so restrictive that you do not have full use
of your fingers.

How strong they must be depends on the job you are doing.

If you are stripping paint with chemicals or working with solvents, oils or acids, the gloves should be impervious to such chemicals. If handling
concrete or sawing, the gloves will need to withstand a lot of wear. There are even reinforced gloves for use when operating cutting
machinery&mdash;which should resist a saw blade (to some degree) turning at speed.


If working with dust or installing loft insulation, you should wear gloves which fit to the wrist with an elasticated band to prevent particles
from falling inside.


Gloves should not make your hands sweat&mdash;leather and canvas seem the best materials, although there are numerous alternatives. For lighter
work, consider disposable paper/ plastic alternatives.

If gloves become heavily soiled, or contaminated inside, they should be discarded&mdash;unless specified as washable.

If you really CAN&#39;T wear gloves to do the job&mdash;not even &#39;surgeon&#39;s gloves&#39;&mdash;or if you cannot wear both gloves, protect
the skin with barrier cream.


### Footwear


Good footwear should have thick, non-slip, rubber soles-which can resist piercing, acids and grease. It should also provide you with safety from
electrocution.


The uppers should ideally be steel-reinforced to prevent: crushing of toes when a heavy object falls on your feet; cutting or stabbing feet with
gardening tools, chainsaws or axes; burning of the feet from (for instance) droplets of molten metal, while welding.


The shoes/boots should be comfortable enough to wear and stand in for long periods of time. Thick socks may make them more
comfortable&mdash;remember to wear these socks when you try the footwear on.


### Protecting eyes


To be any good at all, eye protectors must be fairly comfortable and allow near-perfect vision. If scratched or worn, they should be replaced.
They should not &#39;steam up&#39;. Depending on the task in hand, they should resist impact from flying debris, dust penetration (around the
sides) and splashes with chemicals. It is ESSENTIAL that they be shatterproof.


There are various types available. For some jobs, where the main danger is flying debris or splashed chemicals, &#39;spectacle&#39;-style
eyeshields may suffice. They are easy to put on and remove. Don&#39;t use them if there is any danger of them falling off, or being knocked off.
An adjustable band which goes right round the head would make them safer.


Whole-face screens, which hinge up and down&mdash;so they can quickly be lifted out of the way&mdash;are very good for flying debris and chemical
splashes. They protect the whole face, and in some cases, the front of the neck as well. Drifting dust will find its way in, though. This form of
protection might be your only choice if you wear glasses.


Goggles with an elastic strap which goes round your head, like those worn by skiers, may be essential to keep dust out of your eyes. They may be
prone to steaming up.


If welding, you will need eye protection in the form of a whole-face shield with a clear (tinted) portion which filters out the harmful intense
light&mdash;if your sight is to be protected AND your skin (<a href="#welding">see Welding</a>).


### Hearing protectors


Think of them as &#39;hearing protectors&#39;&mdash;not EAR protectors. They should be worn with almost any power tool or noisy process. Most
people don&#39;t realise that their hearing is at risk from loud noise. It&#39;s common to feel a temporary effect, which ranges from muffled
hearing to a &#39;ringing&#39; in the ears. Eventually, this temporary hearing loss can become permanent.


Hearing protectors (which look like headphones) are easy to wear. The headband should be movable so that you could also wear a safety helmet. You
should still be able to hear a little-in case an accident happens, something falls, or someone shouts for help.

Wax earplugs are efficient, for most people, but not very convenient. Cotton wool (cotton) is useless.

### Breathing protection


Inhalation of dust or fumes may present an extremely serious long-term health hazard. Breathing protection is VITAL. Smog masks, made of cloth or
paper, are not sufficient-except for protection from larger debris. Even so, you should replace them frequently&mdash;as soon as you can see any
build-up of dust on them.


An improvized mask of several layers of thin cotton fabric, anchored in place with elastic around the head, is more efficient than a smog mask or
many simple disposable masks-providing it is &#39;moulded&#39; well around the nose and mouth. If you have a thick beard, this may be your only
choice, unless you go for something very elaborate.


Most face masks are called &#39;nuisance masks&#39; and will cope with non-toxic larger-particle hazards like glass-fibre, loft insulation and
(less so) sanding dust. They need replacing frequently. If they have replaceable filters, it may be possible to insert more than one.

:::tip[REMEMBER]


Filter masks all &#39;leak&#39; to some degree or another. Change filters regularly and limit exposure as much as possible. DON&#39;T consider
masks an alternative to dust/debris collection at source and proper ventilation.

:::

Fumes or poisonous dust (even suspected poisons) require a tougher mask altogether. It may even be necessary to go for a gas-mask type, which
covers the whole face. There are even versions with their own air supply.


### Head protection


Look for proper helmets and accept only those guaranteed against impact and penetration. The helmet MUST fit and be comfortable enough so that you
don&#39;t avoid wearing it.


It must also stay on. A chin strap is a good idea (if comfortable) to prevent the helmet falling off. Try a helmet before you buy it. Lean forward
and see if it stays on.


There should be some air circulation, to avoid excessive sweating&mdash;sweat might run into your eyes. If you need to wear hearing protectors,
check that this is still possible.


The cranium protectors worn by cyclists and climbers allow free movement and afford quite a lot of protection. These may be suitable where slips
and falls are the main hazard&mdash;but many have open sections which won&#39;t protect the head from falling objects or flying debris.


### Sun protection


Never underestimate the power of the sun when working outside. Even a ten-minute job can turn into a couple of hours, and before you know it you
could be burnt to a frazzle&mdash;with the added risks of sun/heatstroke and skin cancer. Cover exposed skin with high-protection sun screen,
particularly vulnerable areas such as the back of the neck, and wear a hat (especially if you&#39;re a &#39;bit thin&#39; on top!). In hotter,
humid climates the recommended fluid intake for someone doing manual labour is four litres a day&mdash;be aware of the danger of dehydration.
Properly-filtered sunglasses are a must&mdash;fashion &#39;shades&#39; do not offer adequate protection.
