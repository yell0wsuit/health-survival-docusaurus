We are constantly reminded that the world is a dangerous place&mdash;pollution, food processing, violence and natural disasters are all beyond our
direct control. City life adds further stresses, which may become too much to bear.

## **BE A SURVIVOR!**

Every man, woman and child has to face a multitude of dangers in their lives. The added pressures of urban life can often make those VITAL to
understand the dangers at home, at work, on the streets (at least) and to get to grips with as many as possible. Take control! The safer you make
your day-to-day existence, the better able you will be (and the more time and energy you will have) to deal with major crises. How can you expect
to deal with a serious health, emotional or financial set-back, if you&#39;re totally preoccupied with surviving the dangers of your own home?

Your strategy must be to avoid unnecessary risks in the urban environment and minimize the damage caused by those you can&#39;t avoid. You must
develop an attitude to urban life that will help you cope with all kinds of situations.

![ ](/images/img008_002.jpg)

### Safety and security

The first place to make safe and secure MUST be your home. Make sure that the structure of the building is safe and keep it that way. Prepare it
to withstand both the pressures of natural forces and the added hazards of modern cities. Older houses, in particular, may be affected by damp,
insect infestation, rot, settlement and subsidence. All fixtures and fittings should be carefully checked to ensure that they do not invite
accident and immediate action taken if they do.

Everything must be made secure against intruders primarily because YOU might be at risk. People have been attacked and even held hostage in their
own homes. If you decide to put things right yourself, make sure you really CAN do the job. In the end, it may not be worth the aggravation.
Unskilled DIY is the cause of an enormous number of injuries&mdash;bodged jobs can lead to more stress and further accidents.

The workplace needs to be as safe and secure as the home. It may include machinery, chemical hazards or processes that are highly dangerous. Many
jobs are made difficult enough by heavy competition and stress. At home, you may be able to sort things out yourself, but it&#39;s more
complicated to deal with dangers at work and in public places.

Leisure activities, too, bring their own risks. The element of danger may give a &#39;thrill&#39; which is an essential part of some hobbies and
sports &ndash; but a severe injury could be disastrous.

Travel, for business or for pleasure, brings new risks to be assessed and prepared for. There have always been the problems of adapting to a
change of diet and climate, and having to cope with a society whose language and social rules you do not understand. These are made worse by jet
lag, the strain of airport high-security procedures and the fear of terrorism. Wherever you are, there is a possibility of danger from natural
phenomena and from human violence &ndash; you could get caught up in an earthquake or be mugged.

## **AGAINST ALL ODDS**

Take control of yourself, your health and your immediate surroundings. On a simple practical level, there&#39;s a lot you can do to make life
safer and less complicated&mdash;but you must do so against a backdrop of constant natural and man-made danger. You can&#39;t change the world,
but you can HELP! Minimize the risks to yourself by understanding some of the dangers. DON&#39;T contribute to the world-pollution crisis.

### Natural enemies

Some hazards exist as part of nature. There is a huge number of poisonous plants commonly found in gardens or indoors as pot plants. Some are
deadly if eaten, others cause irritation when they come into contact with the skin. DO NOT eat any plant, unless it is already a recognized
&#39;food&#39;. Even some everyday food plants are poisonous if eaten in their raw state, including the familiar potato. Its flowers, Leaves and
stems are poisonous, as are the potatoes themselves if eaten raw&mdash;especially if they are green!

Cockroaches, fleas, rats and other common vermin help to spread disease. Rats alone have been responsible for the spread of plague (transmitted by
rat fleas) and a serious illness called Weil&#39;s disease is carried in their urine. And, of course, there is a multitude of poisonous and
dangerous animals, reptiles, fish and insects the world over&mdash;from Australia to India and America to the Arctic Circle.

There is even a risk from the life-giving sun itself. Over-exposure, Especially of skin that hasn&#39;t seen the sun for months, can lead to skin
cancers if no protective barrier is worn.

Radon gas is major hazard, although not specifically a city problem. It occurs mainly in areas built on granite, where the rock contains uranium
238 and thorium. Official figures indicates that radon gas is responsible for 20,000 deaths in the USA alone, everyone year. The carcinogenic
(cancer-producing) gas rises through the ground and up into buildings. Sealing floors and improving ventilation is one of the recommendations for
reducing exposure.

### Pollution

Many of the environmental problems of our cities can be traced directly to ourselves. In most densely-populated parts of the world, industrial,
domestic and traffic emissions so pollute the environment that large numbers of the population &ndash; especially children-suffer from respiratory
problems and various forms of chemical poisoning.

It is only really in this century that people began to realize the link between industrial and domestic smoke and air pollution. Avoiding the
filthy air was one reason why cities spread away from their industrial hearts.

Clean-air legislation has make some progress, but traffic emissions and the burning of fossil fuels still pollute the air of most of the
world&#39;s cities. Often the atmosphere is so contaminated that even the buildings are being slowly eaten away by the chemical-laden air and
rain.

Of course. It is not just our cities that are affected by air pollution. When major atmospheric pollution combines with moisture, sulphuric acid,
sulphites and sulphur dioxide are produced. These spread around the globe, falling as acid rain. This affects people, trees, plants and animals
thousands of miles away. It also leaches mercury, iron, cadmium and magnesium out of soil to pollute streams and rivers, further poisoning fish
and other wildlife.

The acid content of the water increases the risks of poisoning the drinking supply. Many harmful chemicals also escape the filters of the
water-treatment systems.

Gases such as carbon dioxide have built up in the atmosphere, contributing to a so-called global warming&mdash;the &#39;greenhouse
effect&#39;&mdash;which may dramatically change the world&#39;s climate and sea levels. Inadequate controls and accidents have led to horrific
spillages of radiation, poisonous gases and chemicals, often in densely populated areas.

:::info[Chemical Sprays]

If you must use <a href="./urban-poison#pesticides">pesticides</a>, fungicides or weedkillers in your own garden, be careful to avoid skin
contact or inhalation of droplets or vapors. Even those of low toxicity can do you harm. Toxic effects vary considerably, but most of the
chemicals you will use will persist in the soil. DDT is now banned, in most countries, but even a newborn baby has traces in its body tissues.
2, 4, 5-T was found to cause horrific disorders, several years ago, but is still available.

:::

### Radiation

There has always been a background level of radioactivity from natural sources, but the development of nuclear power whether for peaceful or
military purposes-has greatly increased the risks. Incidents such as those at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island have made our worst fears REAL.
Fallout from Chernobyl has disastrously affected an enormous number of lives in many countries.

:::danger[Warning]

X-rays have been found to cause ionization in the living cells through which they pass. It is known that they can have a cumulative effect on
the body-and should only be given when absolutely necessary. X-ray &#39;photographs&#39; are produced because some body tissues absorb higher
levels of radiation than others. Bones absorb the most, so they appear as a lighter image on the plate. Changes can occur in bone marrow and
white blood cells. Keep a personal record of any x-rays&mdash;part of body, date, reason&mdash;not forgetting dental x-rays.

:::

### We are what we eat

Much of the food we eat now often carries a heavy dosage of chemicals absorbed from <a href="./urban-poison#pesticides">pesticides</a> and
artificial fertilizers (which also leach into waterways and pollute them). Many foods are also over-processed or in some way &#39;interfered
with&#39; before they reach us.

For the city dweller, growing your own food&mdash;however organically&mdash;is no longer safe. Research has suggested that home-grown vegetables
in many city gardens absorb even more pollutants from the air than are present in most non-organically grown farm produce. Lettuce is the
worst&mdash;it absorbs more nitrates and lead than any other vegetable.

It may not be safe to eat food grown within a seven-mile radius of a major city. Large airports also produce toxins, causing (for instance) very
high levels of aluminium in the soil.

### Processed foods

Food marketing today seems to try to make all food look appealing. Food may have been treated with bleach or colourings. Various additives may be
used to provide or increase flavour or aroma, preservatives to make the food keep longer. Fruit may be sprayed or painted with wax. Irradiation is
also being used in some countries to kill organisms and increase shelf life of &#39;fresh&#39; products. It is claimed this process has no ill
effects. Experts differ on this, but there is serious concern&mdash;not least because it is not detectable in most foods. All these additives and
processes are IN ADDITION TO the chemicals used in growing produce.

ALL fruit and vegetables must be THOROUGHLY washed. It is advisable that they should also be peeled, unless you are quite sure that they have been
organically grown without the use of <a href="./urban-poison#pesticides">pesticides</a>. If you like cooking with the zest of citrus fruit or
baking potatoes in their jackets, you should always be very careful.

### It&#39;s up to us

We have got to live with these problems and do everything we can to improve things. It will mean a dramatic change in attitudes&mdash;especially
in our cities&mdash;to conserve energy and produce it in less harmful ways. We are all aware of most of the problems, but action on both the
personal and governmental level still lags far behind what&#39;s needed. In many cases we have learned too late&mdash;the damage has already been
done. In some places the countryside, its wildlife and even its people, are sick and dying. We are all at risk. This is the background against
which you have to solve all your other problems.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

The growth of knowledge and understanding, followed by positive action, which has occurred over environmental issues is an example of the
pattern which YOU should apply to every aspect of your life. Ignorance is definitely NOT bliss! It is a killer. The more you know and
understand, the better you can cope with any situation. Knowledge will give you confidence and experience will increase your abilities.

:::

## **BODY MATTERS**

It&#39;s up to YOU to make sure that you have a balanced diet and proper exercise. Monitor your own health and have regular medical
check-ups&mdash;particularly if you smoke cigarettes, drink a lot of alcohol or have a hazardous/high-stress job. How much you need to eat depends
on your physique and the kind of life you lead. Exercise will be more necessary if you have a sedentary job than if your work involves physical
exertion.

Most people have a pretty good idea of when they are over or under weight. If you&#39;re worried about being fat or skinny you should check with
your doctor, before adopting a particular diet. There could be non-dietary reasons for your condition or you may be worrying needlessly. There are
a great many cases of severe dietary disorders each year, due to people having distorted ideas of what is a &#39;perfect&#39; physique.

In the 1980s, many people&mdash;worried by all the media coverage on diet, sport, fitness and longevity&mdash;took to eating pasta and salads.
Both are good for you, but don&#39;t constitute an adequate diet on their own. Many people became &#39;hooked&#39; on exercise as
well&mdash;doctors found that some of their patients were literally exhausted!

Vitamin and other dietary supplements should not be necessary, unless you feel particularly &#39;run down&#39; or you&#39;ve been ill. A mixture
of vegetables, fruit, meat and fish and dairy products is generally believed to provide all the proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals
which you need. In recent years, many people have cut down on the amount of meat they eat&mdash;many have stopped eating meat altogether. A
vegetarian or vegan diet needs more careful planning to ensure the body gets all the nutrients it needs when animal fats and proteins are
excluded.

:::info[VITAMIN OVERDOSE]

Excessive vitamin intake can do as much harm as having too little&mdash;especially for the very young, the elderly and pregnant women.
It&#39;s quite common to reach toxic levels of some vitamins, especially with today&#39;s super-high-dose supplements. A boost of vitamin C,
for example, has long been thought to help fight common colds (although there is little scientific evidence for it). An excess increases the
risk of forming kidney stones. Excessive doses during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants, producing symptoms very
like scurvy. Effervescent tablets often consist largely of sodium bicarbonate and this would be a risk to patients on a low sodium diet for
heart or blood pressure problems. Natural vitamin C from citrus fruits, for example, should be adequate.

:::

### Exercise

Don&#39;t suddenly take up strenuous exercise if you have been inactive for a long time. You should have a medical check-up first. You have to
build up your stamina gradually and match the kind of exercise you do to your age and condition. Most injuries in amateurs occur in the first few
weeks of a season when people are out of practice&mdash;evidence enough that sudden exercise can be damaging.

In fact, every sport and exercise session should start with a warm-up (<a href="./topicid-951#sport">see WORK &amp; PLAY: Sport</a>). Walking and
swimming provide excellent exercise for all ages and are safe for most people.

:::danger[Warning]

If you find that ANY exercise you undertake puts you under uncomfortable strain, causes chest pain or shooting pains down the arms, STOP AT
ONCE. You may be overdoing it. Have a medical check-up and then opt for a gentler form of exercise. You can increase the work your body has to
do, as it develops greater strength and stamina. NEVER take strenuous exercise classes in conditions which are very hot or very humid compared
with those in which you normally live.

:::

### Chemical risks

In addition to the toxic substances in the environment and in our food, there are a huge amount of poisons lying around in every home or in daily
use at work.

There are great dangers in presuming that all over-the counter medicinal preparations are totally safe&mdash;and appropriate for the condition YOU
think you have. Many people dose themselves up to toxic levels.

Children are probably at greatest risk&mdash;young developing bodies won&#39;t process chemicals efficiently. In some countries (including
Britain) it has been decided that aspirin and products containing aspirin are NOT suitable for children under twelve years of age. As we get old,
our bodies become more delicate again-it&#39;s wise to take a smaller amount and reduce the maximum dosage period of drugs like paracetamol.

The threat of poisoning is ever-present, though&mdash;with the bewildering range of toxic and potentially-toxic substances in the house, garden
and garage/shed (<a href="./urban-poison">see POISONS</a>).

### Substance abuse

It should not be necessary to warn about hard drugs&mdash;in most countries they are illegal&mdash;but drug-taking has long been common among
young people and those under stress. Quite apart from the physical and mental damage which misuse of drugs can do, obtaining drugs requires
&#39;stepping outside the law&#39;, in most countries. Funding a serious habit sometimes leads to further involvement in crime.

Drug tolerance (larger doses are gradually needed for the same effect) and dependency can develop very rapidly&mdash;DON&#39;T RISK GETTING
HOOKED!

It has often been claimed that the occasional social use of cannabis does much less harm than smoking cigarettes. Prolonged use of cannabis may
carry a higher risk of lung cancer when mixed with tobacco. Animal tests have indicated that the immune system may be weakened and that the sperm
count in males may be lowered. Cannabis does not create physical dependence&mdash;there are no definite withdrawal effects.

Greater danger may be in contaminants which are likely in cannabis&mdash;powerful weedkillers have been found in some samples. In a purified form,
cannabis is being considered for various medicinal purposes.

The effects of amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, heroin and heroin derivatives, solvents, glues and other &#39;abused&#39; substances are much
more quantifiable&mdash;and much more harmful. All have been associated with countless deaths. But while you sit shaking your head with dismay
that so many people seem to abuse their bodies with so many chemicals, how much alcohol do you drink? Although legal and socially acceptable in
most countries, alcohol IS poisonous. It causes millions of deaths directly by poisoning and indirectly through accidents, violence and loss of
judgement.

Tranquillizers are taken by thousands of people every day and can lead to the same &#39;addictive&#39; pattern of tolerance and dependence as
&#39;illegal&#39; drugs. They should, if absolutely necessary, only be taken for short periods. As soon as you find yourself desperately wanting
or needing a repeat prescription to be able to cope with life, you are on a dangerous path. You MUST try other methods of relieving stress. You
need to talk about your problems, solve some of them, find a counsellor or help-group. These will give you long-term help&mdash;tranquillizers
WON&#39;T. Investigate relaxation techniques.

:::danger[Warning]

If you use any relaxant, hallucinogenic or mood-changing drugs-tranquillizers, alcohol, cannabis, LSD, cocaine, heroin, for example-do NOT
drive a vehicle or operate machinery while under the influence. You may feel perfectly capable, but your reactions and decision-making
abilities are affected. If ALCOHOL is combined with other drugs it can cause serious problems, even with prescribed drugs. For pregnant women
these are even more serious since the fetus can be affected.

:::
:::info[ARE YOU AN ADDICT]

There are other &#39;social addictions&#39; that can produce adverse effects. How many cups of tea or coffee do you drink in a day? Tea
contains tannin, both contain caffeine&mdash;as do soft drinks such as &#39;cola&#39;. Caffeine acts first as a stimulant and then a
depressant. It can cause insomnia, nausea, gastric disorders, palpitations and nervous anxiety. Links have been suggested with cancer and
benign lumps in the breast. There may be risks to foetuses during pregnancy and to breast-fed babies, if large quantities are consumed.

:::

## **STRESS**

Stress is an unavoidable part of living and it&#39;s VITAL that you learn to minimize it&mdash;and to cope with it or reduce its harmful effects.
Every life has its problems, but city life tends to magnify stress. Travelling to and from work in crowded public transport or driving in
rush-hour conditions can be a considerable twice-daily strain. Fear of attack in the streets, dodging traffic, being buffeted by crowds&mdash;it
all adds up.

At work&mdash;and work problems rate very highly amongst causes of stress&mdash;pressures may be enormous. Some people live in constant fear of
being sacked or made redundant. There may be delivery dates or deadlines to meet and aggressively competitive colleagues. Management may be
difficult or unsympathetic. There may be sexual or racial harassment. You may have to deal with ill-tempered customers or clients. Strangely
enough some people seem to &#39;thrive&#39; on such pressures, but for most of us it&#39;s quite impossible. Sometimes, if anything else happens
to us in other areas of our lives, the pressure just gets too great to bear.

Being unemployed can be just as stressful-it affects both public- and self-image and deprives you of MONEY&mdash;which is unfortunately vital for
urban survival.

Stress is really a blanket term for excessive emotional pressure. It can be provided by (or focused on) something quite minor&mdash;a dripping
tap, a persistent smell, or constant background noise, such as that produced by air-conditioning.

Poor living conditions are not only physically unhealthy, but depressing and stress-inducing. Fear of illness, attack or robbery can all prey on
the mind. Research increasingly supports the contention that people are more susceptible to depression and stress at certain times of the year.
When days are shorter and light levels lower, more people succumb to stress.

Worries about sexual matters and relationships can be very destructive, but the most stressful events in most people&#39;s lives are those which
create sudden changes. Death of a family member or a friend, divorce, redundancy, unemployment, moving house, starting a new job are all at the
top of the list for causing stress. Even &#39;happy&#39; events such as a marriage or the birth of a child can cause great anxiety.

Parents may worry&mdash;sometimes excessively&mdash;about their children. Often these worries don&#39;t subside when the children are grown into
adults themselves!

:::info[RESTORE THE BALANCE]

Stress puts extra demands on the body, burning up nutrients to fuel your nervous energy. That is why people under stress tend to lose weight
and anxiety produces a drawn and gaunt appearance. To help the body cope with the physical effects of stress, make sure it has the particular
nutrients that are important for the nervous system and body functions.

Calcium and zinc are burned up under stress and need replacement. Vitamin B1 is needed to control nerve conduction and reaction. Vitamin B2 is
needed to control the breakdown of fats and carbohydrates in the liver to ensure wastes and toxins do not accumulate, making you more tired
and sluggish. Vitamin B3 is needed to help control the amount of oxygen-carrying red cells in the blood. Since B vitamins are NOT stored in
the body, because they are water-soluble, you need a constant supply.

:::

### Dealing with stress

Recognizing the causes of stress in YOUR life is the first step. Make it a challenge to identify and sort out problems&mdash;don&#39;t let things
pile on top of you. Stress really drags you down mentally and puts you at great risk physically.

You need to find something better to do than worry. If you can sort out your day-to-day life to reduce stress, you can start to look ahead to
possible problems and try to avert disasters before they happen. If you&#39;re overcome by your present problems, how will you cope if anything
major goes wrong? You are starting from the wrong place!

Overcoming stress requires great self-control. You need to be able to clear your thoughts and make both body and mind relax. This also helps
create a calm and balanced attitude which will greatly reduce the impact of stress situations.

:::info[CAN YOU REDUCE STRESS?]

Are you ALWAYS rushing about? Do you NEED to place yourself under so much stress? Can you have the occasional quiet day or evening? Can you
travel at a different time or use a different route or another form of transport? Is it really necessary to be so competitive? Is that
difficult relationship worth the damage it causes? Take a look at your lifestyle, review it and assess what you want. Think about changing
your job for something less demanding. Let life centre around something else!

:::

Different people have different ways of relieving tension. Tranquillizers, alcohol, smoking, drugs, eating and violence are NOT solutions. They
are the traps people fall into. If you&#39;re lucky and have a creative hobby, the concentration involved can be very therapeutic. When a project
is completed, you may feel genuinely proud of yourself. Anything which can build confidence and self-esteem is worthwhile.

### Work out your problems

Finding solutions to your problems is obviously the best way of removing stress. When that seems impossible you can free yourself for a while by
concentrating on physical exertion to help the mind and body relax. Exercise is a great way of overcoming stress. After a good workout your
problems don&#39;t seem so bad. The tension and anxiety go from your body and you see things in a different light.

Repetitive exercises can be calming and the burning up of energy is like releasing a pressure valve to rid you of built-up tension. Don&#39;t get
hooked on exercise, though, and make sure your diet compensates for the energy expended. Try to &#39;train&#39; with a friend&mdash;you can pace
each other and it&#39;s a lot less boring than doing it on your own.

### Relaxation

Proper relaxation is not just putting your feet up and watching television&mdash;though that can have its role in taking your mind off worries.
Learn to relax properly. There are numerous relaxation &#39;techniques&#39;&mdash;each person needs to find one that works for them. Try this:

1. Put on some loose clothing and lie on your back on a bed or on the floor. Reach out with your toes and the top of your head, making yourself
   as &#39;tall&#39; as possible. Release and relax.
2. Try to empty your mind. If you can&#39;t, focus on something peaceful and restful&mdash;the sea, the sky, a tree. If you can&#39;t keep your
   problems from popping into your head, mentally grab hold of something simple and familiar&mdash;an egg, a cup, a button. Don&#39;t let
   anything else into your mind. Imagine you are floating on air.
3. When your mind is clear, begin to tense and release all the body&#39;s muscle groups in turn. Start with the toes, one foot at a time. Follow
   with the legs, buttocks, abdomen, back, chest, fingers, hands, arms and neck. Do one group at a time, relax that group and move on to the
   next. Finally tense the whole body then relax.

Try a variation on this relaxation exercise. Imagine each part of your body is growing very heavy and sinking through the floor. You should soon
feel the tension drain away. Investigate local relaxation classes or try yoga or meditation.

### Learn to breathe!

Controlled breathing is another way of combatting stress. When you are tense your breathing tends to be short and shallow. Slow it down and make
it deeper. Pay attention to how you exhale. As you do, let your whole body relax.

Stand with your hands on your hips, elbows slightly forward, shoulders slightly rounded. Now breathe in for a count of three, hold for three and
exhale for three. Keep this going until you have full control and the rhythm becomes natural. Breathe in through the nose and out through the
mouth.

Use your lungs completely. Let your abdomen rise and fall&mdash;don&#39;t let your chest heave up and down. Try it lying down in a darkened room.
Imagine the room is filled with pure clean white light&mdash;your body is filled with dark smoke. Each time you breathe in you take in the white
light. Each time you exhale you release the dark smoke.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Relaxation and meditation techniques can be learnt, but just being alone and calm from time to time may give your mind a chance to relax. At
the very least, this sort of &#39;private&#39; time enables you to devote your thoughts to sorting out your problems.

:::
:::info[MASSAGE]

Relieving physical tension is the first step to relieving mental stress. If you have a partner get them to massage your neck muscles, your
shoulders and the top of your spine. Even better, go to a masseur and enjoy the luxury of a full massage. To release neck tension on your own
move the head rapidly backwards a few times in a very gentle motion. Push it slightly further than it wants to go with a bouncing action. Now
bounce it forwards and to each side&mdash;again, very gently. Let it roll relaxed to one side and roll it through a full 360 degrees, keeping
it relaxed. There, did that help?

:::

### Counselling

A problem shared is a problem halved. DON&#39;T let problems build up inside you. DON&#39;T hold grudges and brood about things. Hard though it
may seem, it&#39;s better to &#39;bite the bullet&#39; and get the problem out into the open with the people concerned rather than bottle
everything up to explosion point. Discuss worries with a close friend. If you don&#39;t feel you can share your problems with anyone you know,
seek professional counselling and help-groups. It is often easier to get a new perspective on problems with people who don&#39;t know you.

### Fear

Fear is an element in most forms of mental stress&mdash;fear of the unknown and the known, fear of not being able to cope, fear of violence. It is
not something to be ashamed of, but you must NOT let it build up out of proportion. Fear is a natural emotion and not necessarily harmful. When
people are suddenly very afraid, they can run faster, jump higher and do things they never thought possible. This is due to the adrenalin the body
produces in a stressful situation. It can make feats of superhuman strength achievable.

Fear can even be an asset. It makes you wary and more alert on the streets, for instance. Don&#39;t try to eliminate it with false courage or deny
its existence.

Panic is fear that gets out of control. You MUST control panic&mdash;it can be disastrous. You must learn to use fear and anxiety&mdash;not let
them use you. Don&#39;t let your imagination run riot and conjure things to be scared of. Assess the real situation and confront it.

Learn to think and plan when you are afraid. One way is to enrol on a survival course and be put under pressure while being carefully monitored.
You must get to know yourself.

### The violent city

For many people the greatest threat in city life is that of violence. Media reports suggest that muggings and other violent assaults have
increased considerably in recent years. At the same time, people seem less and less prepared to go to the help of others. There is not much point
in exposing yourself to serious physical risks if you can&#39;t really help. You can, however, at least call the police or an ambulance. Too many
people don&#39;t even do that&mdash;they don&#39;t want to be &#39;involved&#39;.

Avoid violence. Don&#39;t make yourself vulnerable&mdash;use your common sense&mdash;but don&#39;t shut yourself indoors. What is the point of
being in a city if you cannot enjoy city life? Be sensible about where you go alone, especially at night. Know your city, avoid any areas known to
be dangerous. Be aware of local problems and don&#39;t provoke violence by your behaviour. Wearing a football team&#39;s colours and shouting
abuse about the other side&#39;s supporters is a sure way to get your nose flattened. Don&#39;t take short cuts through dark alleys.

Sometimes attack comes out of the blue. That&#39;s when it is useful to have some knowledge of self-defence. Follow the basic advice given later
<a href="./topicid-136">(see SELF-DEFENCE</a>) , but think about taking a proper course. You&#39;ll learn much better from an instructor than from
any book&mdash;but don&#39;t expect an attacker to keep to the rules. You may need to let fly with everything you&#39;ve got. Learn how to use
your natural weapons.

### Terrorism and armed violence

The use of terrorism for political ends has been a growing problem in recent years. We have to learn to live with it and to be vigilant. Whilst
you cannot deal with bombs and suspect packages and vehicles personally, you can report any suspicions and let the experts sort them out. Be
alert. Learn what the procedures are for hostile action against your workplace, whether by terrorists or armed robbers, so that you will be able
to respond rapidly and calmly.

### Catastrophes

There are some situations that really are beyond our control, from train crashes to natural disasters. That does not mean that you cannot be
prepared for them. Developing your own skills and reactions will help you to avoid accidents and enable you to assist others who are involved in
them.

If you live in places where earthquakes, floods or hurricanes could strike, you must learn to prepare for them, evacuate as necessary or deal with
the aftermath. As with everything else in life, awareness, knowledge, confidence, training and experience will set you up to be a good survivor.

### Being prepared

You are what you think you are. You will achieve what you think you will&mdash;at least, you have little chance of achieving ANYTHING if you
don&#39;t believe you can! Other people will have widely different opinions about you, but it is what YOU really think of yourself that matters.
Confidence in yourself and self-knowledge must be backed up by what you have learned about your city and how to deal with situations.

Of course, no two problems are identical. There is no advice that can cover EVERY situation. Develop the ability to take in and assess a situation
quickly, then apply a calm and logical solution based on what you know and what you have learned. No one can hope to do better than that.

:::info[SURVIVAL KIT FOR THE CITY]

Equip yourself to deal with small day-to-day problems. If you know what your programme is for the day, you will carry what you need&mdash;but
you should also carry an emergency kit to cope with some of those unforeseen occurrences. It need not take up much space&mdash;a small tin
like a tobacco tin is ideal, but you shouldn&#39;t smoke the tobacco! Always carry your kit with you and it will see you through many a
crisis. With it you can (at least):

-   Repair a tear

Start with this as the standard kit and personalize it to suit YOUR needs and YOUR lifestyle. Cyclists and motorists could have their own
versions. You may need a tiny screwdriver (especially if you wear glasses), antihistamine tablets (if you get hay fever), other medicines,
tampons, condoms, a spare pair of contact lenses or eye drops, matches, breath fresheners, something to tie long hair back&mdash;you name it!

Keep the kit you carry small and easy to slip into a pocket or your handbag. If it becomes too bulky or inconvenient to carry, you will leave
it at home on just the day you need it! It is like wearing a seat belt in a car. You wear it every time you drive&mdash;but the day you forget
it is the day you have an accident! It is the same with your emergency kit. Carry it ALL THE TIME.
