Maintaining your health is largely down to common sense, but may be difficult against constant city stresses. Judging the seriousness Of an injury
or illness and-knowing how to apply first aid may help you to save a life.

## **Take control**

The prime responsibility for your health rests with you. True, not everyone has an ideal start in life—poverty, poor housing, family
break-up, and the possibility of inherited disease or handicap may mean that from birth onwards your health has been affected by factors that are
totally beyond your control.

In addition, you are at the mercy of an environment that includes atmospheric pollution, passive smoking, and overprocessed foods contaminated by
[pesticides](/sas-urban/urban-poison#pesticides) and additives. You may have little or no control over where you live and the kind of work you
do.

Health advice always makes it sound as though all you have to do is follow some simple rules and you’ll be fit, healthy, and live to a ripe
old age. All the same, everyone can do a great deal to improve or maintain the best possible level of health. Inform yourself about the way your
body works. Recognize and act upon any changes you observe, which might indicate that something is going wrong.

Self-neglect—whether caused by an unwillingness to recognize the possibility of disease or the mistaken assumption that your symptoms are
too trivial to ‘bother the doctor’ with—may result in a worsening of the condition, serious permanent disability, or even death.

A positive approach-taking advantage of the many sources of information and advice provided by the media, coupled with a determination to seek
professional help without delay when you’re worried about your health—can reduce the risks of serious illness and premature death. Such
an approach may also slow down the aging process, enabling you to look forward to an active and independent life well beyond the age of 70.

#### It’s up to you

Taking responsibility for your health may involve some quite drastic changes in your lifestyle! Change is never easy. The important first step is
to decide that you WILL adopt a healthier diet, take more exercise, stop smoking, cut out or cut down on alcohol-but don’t try to do it all at
once. Gradual change is far easier to accept than a ‘blitzkrieg’ approach. Each change will bring its own reward, encouraging you to
embark upon the next.

It’s far better to admit that it might take a year or so to reach your target of optimum health, than to try to change habits of a
lifetime—depriving yourself of some of the props that have seemed to keep you going-and become a ‘new’ person overnight. A rushed
approach can lead to failure, discouragement and unwillingness to try again. Ill-advised dietary changes, sudden exercise or stopping regular
medication may have serious side effects. Always seek medical advice before making a change in lifestyle.

Looking after yourself is no longer an option. It’s a necessity. Around the world delays in hospital consultations, the expense of treatment,
shortages of beds and medical supplies have made us realize that most health systems just can’t cope.

:::info[HEALTH CHECK LIST]

There are many very basic ways in which you can influence your own health. You’ve seen them hundreds of times, to the point where we cease
to pay attention. Read them again!

- Eat sensibly. Make sure you have a balanced diet, limiting fats and increasing fibre. Medical opinion does not favour vitamin and mineral
    supplements unless they have been prescribed.
- Don’t drink alcohol or keep your alcohol consumption to a minimum. Alcohol affects your general health and commonly leads to
    irreversible damage to the heart, liver, brain and nervous system.
- Don’t smoke! It is a major cause of general ill health and commonly leads to lung cancer, heart disease and chronic bronchitis, among
    other disorders. Your cigarette smoke can also harm other people.
- Take exercise. It will improve and maintain physical and mental fitness. Match it to your age and condition and choose a form that you
    enjoy. Seek medical advice.
- Watch your weight. Join a club if you find self-restraint is difficult! Seek medical advice.
- Reduce stress. Stress is linked to many serious illnesses/disorders. Talk through your problems with family, friends, employers or
    professional counsellors. Learn relaxation techniques. Make whatever adjustments you can to your lifestyle.

:::

Gone are the days of the traditional family doctor with ‘all the time in the world’ to solve your health and personal problems. The
doctor’s receptionist alone may put you off making an appointment. Now is the time to decide that you will take some responsibility for your
own health. Your first response must NOT be to totally abandon hope that your doctor can and will help you. Nor should it be to rush to pharmacies
and ‘health’ shops to dose yourself up with over-the-counter medicines!

:::tip[PLEASE NOTE]

This section is intended to provide guidelines, advice and information. It can’t offer actual diagnoses or prescribe treatments, but it
may help you recognize and deal with some common conditions and serious emergencies. DON’T use it as a hypochondriac’s handbook!

:::

## **Preventative medicine**

In recent years medical and technical advances have been made in the early diagnosis of illness-in many cases the earlier a problem is treated,
the more successful the treatment. Immunization against certain illnesses has become routine, so that many life-threatening conditions have been
almost eliminated.

### Screening

Some types of screening, such as checking your weight or blood pressure, may be undertaken by your doctor. Certain groups of people are routinely
specifically screened—for instance, pregnant women, newborn babies, people over 75. Those in particular racial groups, people who have
relatives with certain serious disorders, and people who work in hazardous conditions should receive special screening.

You can carry out some types of screening on yourself. Some cancers in their early stages appear as small ‘lumps’-self-examination of
breasts or testes (for instance) for lumps or growths at regular intervals is ESSENTIAL. A doctor or nurse will demonstrate the techniques.

Women have been encouraged, for many years now, to check their breasts for any abnormalities and to report vaginal or abdominal discomfort. Many
men do NOT realize that testicular cancer is increasingly common. The best time to examine the testes is in a warm bath—the scrotum is
relaxed, allowing free movement of the testes.

### Basic screening options

Antenatal screening

- Blood group
- Anaemia
- Haemophilia (high-risk groups)
- Rubella
- Spina bifida (and other congenital defects)
- Hepatitis B, HIV infection (high-risk groups)
- Syphilis
- Chromosomal abnormalities (high-risk groups)
- Sickle-cell disorders (high-risk groups)

:::info[ANAEMIA]

Anaemia is surprisingly common, yet people may suffer for years without knowing what is wrong. The name describes a condition where the number
of haemoglobin molecules in red blood cells is below normal. Haemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues of the body. Anaemia is
usually caused by iron deficiency—iron is an essential component of haemoglobin.

Minor bleeding, such as menstrual blood loss, causes levels of haemoglobin and iron to decrease, but is not usually harmful. However, although
pregnancy stops menstrual blood loss, greater drains are made on iron levels by the developing foetus. Pregnant women are particularly at risk
from anaemia.

SYMPTOMS: Lethargy, tiredness, headaches, brittle nails, pallor, breathing difficulties during exercise, dizziness and pain in the chest.
ACTION: Seek medical assistance. Foods with good sources of iron are fruit, green vegetables, wholemeal bread, lean meat and beans. Iron
supplements are available, but should be taken under medical supervision. An excess of iron in the body is also undesirable.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Adult-strength iron tablets, which look like ‘sweets’, can be extremely dangerous if swallowed by a child. Seek medical attention at
once, if this occurs.

:::

### Infant and child screening

- Heart disease (congenital)
- Hypothyroidism
- Cataracts/visual defects
- Deafness
- Sickle-cell (high-risk groups)
- Testes (displaced or undescended)
- Hip dislocation
- Dental caries (tooth decay)

### Adult screening

- Cervical cancer
- Breast cancer
- Testicular cancer
- Lung cancer
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Glaucoma/visual defects

### Immunization

It is possible to induce or boost immunity to certain serious diseases. All that is usually required is one or more injections of appropriate
vaccines. Immunization against polio is even simpler—the vaccine may be swallowed on a lump of sugar. Immunization has brought many diseases
under control. Smallpox has actually been eradicated!

Routine immunization is given to babies and young children at various ages. Your doctor or clinic will advise on this ([see Childhood diseases](#childhood-diseases)).

Seek advice when you intend to travel abroad. A doctor/ travel adviser will be able to tell you which serious diseases you need to be immunized
against in any particular region ([see Tropical diseases](#tropical-diseases) and [IN TRANSIT](/sas-urban/urban-in-transit)).

The following vaccines are routinely available:

- MMR: Mumps, measles and German measles (rubella)
- DPT: Diphtheria, whooping cough (pertussis) and tetanus
- Polio
- Influenza Only for two out of three strains
- Hepatitis B
- Meningitis Only for two out of three strains
- Cholera
- Typhoid
- Rabies

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Immunization for influenza is normally only given to the elderly or those at occupational risk. Cholera and typhoid vaccines offer only
partial protection. Other precautions, such as food and water hygiene, should be observed in areas where there is a risk of contracting the
diseases.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Vaccines may be dangerous if you are pregnant, if you are HIV positive, if you have cancer or any prolonged fever or infection. Always state
whether you are taking any medication.

:::

## **You and your doctor**

Many doctors would much prefer to be educators, helping you to adopt a healthier lifestyle, suggesting positive ways of self-help, encouraging and
monitoring rather than treating. Whether or not such an ideal is attainable, use your doctor’s knowledge, help and advice to prevent ill
health in the first place. The traditional idea that a visit to a doctor is only necessary if you are actually ill is gradually changing.

Preventative medicine must involve a two-way discussion between you and your doctor on ways you can spot trouble before it becomes serious. More
important, you need advice on how to make sure that problems are less likely to occur.

However, most people still only see a doctor when they experience illness, pain or discomfort—to seek reassurance, advice or
treatment—or worse still, when their condition is so serious that emergency action (such as instant hospital admission) is required.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

When you visit your doctor, it is VITAL that he/she understands what is troubling you. Although doctors are trained to communicate with their
patients, you might find your doctor difficult to talk to or understand. Don’t feel inhibited about discussing personal
matters—he/she is professionally bound to keep your conversation confidential. You should be free to talk about anything that is
bothering you. It is possible that you and your doctor might not ‘get on’. Find another doctor.

:::

### Get organized

The responsibility for describing and pointing out symptoms lies with YOU—your doctor cannot read your mind. There are some important ways
in which you can prepare for a visit to the doctor, to make the best use of the time:

- Check in your own mind why you want an appointment.
- Think over how you have been feeling. Have there been any significant changes in your eating habits, your bowel habits or sleeping patterns?
- Think about any particular worries that you may have.
- Make notes-your mind might go blank during a consultation or you might forget something important.
- Always be totally honest.

### How doctors work

A consultation with your doctor usually involves several processes. The first is history-taking-the doctor asks a series of carefully selected
questions, which are designed to build up a picture of your problems. While you are talking, a good doctor will not only be listening but also
seeing whether your appearance gives clues to your state of health. He/she is checking to see if you look relaxed and generally fit and healthy.
Your skin, hair, eyes and teeth all can give indications of your general condition.

If your doctor thinks it necessary he/she may move on to the next process—a physical examination.

### Diagnosis

It is not always possible for a doctor to make an immediate diagnosis and it would not be proper for him/her to guess at your condition.

If the doctor has taken a blood or urine sample, for example, there may be a delay until the results of tests have been returned. If the doctor is
able to diagnose your condition at once, it is VITAL that you understand the explanation the doctor gives you, and the prescription and the
treatment he/she recommends. Write down any instructions and ask for an explanation of any part of the diagnosis that is too ‘technical’.

Finally, FOLLOW THE DOCTOR’S ORDERS-but if the suggested treatment does not appear to be effective, make another appointment.

:::danger[Warning]

If you suspect serious illness or you are in considerable pain seek medical assistance-go to your doctor, call your doctor or (if necessary)
call an ambulance. Of course it may be a false alarm, but a good doctor prefers a patient who is worried about a symptom to raise the alarm,
rather than suffer in silence.

You may hold back because you don’t want to ‘bother’ a doctor, but you are not qualified to decide whether a problem is serious or
not. If there is any risk at all that the condition could be serious, speedy diagnosis and treatment are VITAL.

If you need a doctor to visit you at home, telephone early in the day, so that the doctor can plan the day’s visits;

If you, or a child, may be suffering from an infectious disease, don’t carry the infection to the doctor’s waiting room-ask for a home
visit.

If a child’s temperature is raised beyond 39&deg;C (l02&deg;F), it is definitely advisable to ask a doctor to visit.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

X-rays are invaluable and-compared with recent inventions-employ quite basic technology, but they must be used with care. The x-ray
‘image’ is achieved by passing a form of electro-magnetic radiation through the body. An image is created on a photographic plate
behind the body.

The use of this radiation has recently caused great concern. At high levels, it can cause neurological disorders and cancers. The dosage of
radiation necessary to take an x-ray photograph is usually small, but doctors are worried that too many unnecessary x-rays are given. The
effect is cumulative. One report revealed that in the UK at least a fifth of all x-ray examinations did not actually provide new or useful
information. ALWAYS check with the doctor that an x-ray is essential. Keep a personal record of your own x-rays-when they were taken and why.

With heavy workloads in many hospitals, radiologists and occasionally their patients have been exposed to unnecessarily high levels of
radiation from x-rays, as a result of ineffective protective and screening procedures. In some countries x-ray procedures may have to be
closely examined.

:::

### Seeing a specialist

Depending on your particular problem, your doctor may not be able to make a diagnosis from history-taking and a physical examination. You may be
referred to a specialist or consultant, perhaps at a hospital. Consultants and specialists usually focus their training on particular types of
problem and have access to a wide range of high-tech procedures, ‘Imaging’ techniques allow doctors literally to ‘see’ into their
patients.

Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning sound like science
fiction. These techniques use various forms of electro-magnetic rays, sound waves and radioactive substances to create ‘images’.
There’s usually little or no discomfort.

Endoscopy, the use of special viewing instruments that can be inserted into the body, has greatly improved since the advent of fibreoptic
technology. If absolutely necessary, minute samples of possibly diseased tissues can be painlessly removed for examination (biopsy) at the same
time. Quite often, if there is an incision at all, it’s tiny.

### Ultrasound

Ultrasound is a diagnostic method in which high-frequency sound waves are transmitted into the body. Their reflections show images of body organs,
observable on a screen. It is thus possible to detect abnormalities and pinpoint their position. It is claimed that the technique is completely
safe. There is growing concern that the use of ultrasound during pregnancy should be limited to one ‘screening’, unless an abnormality is
found. No one yet knows whether long-term damage to the baby might be caused by too many routine screenings.

## **Treatment**

Even the relatively short space of ten years has transformed some areas of modern medicine. While the basic practices of the doctor’s surgery
remain unchanged, the treatment of illness has seen major advances. Like other areas of modern life, computer technology has speeded up
developments, allowing medical science to discover and understand more about the human body.

### Drugs

Discoveries have also been made in the development and production of new drugs. More is now known about the ways in which many drugs
work—this means they can be made safer and more effective. Modern biochemistry has made it possible to create synthetic drugs, but we still
have an enormous amount to learn about the usefulness of substances found in ‘nature’. More and more naturally-occurring substances are
being ‘discovered’ and put to use.

A better understanding of how the body works has led to the ability—again only recently achieved—to ‘tailor-make’ drugs for
specific purposes. This fine-tuning can result in fewer harmful side effects.

### Surgery

Many surgical procedures have been superseded by less-invasive techniques.

Lithotripsy This is a non-surgical treatment that uses ultrasound to pulverize deposits such as kidney stones in the body. Repeated pulses of
high-energy ultrasound waves are focused on a stone to break it down into particles small enough to be passed out of the body in urine or faeces.

Laser treatment The benefit of the laser-a narrow beam of intense energy—is that it can be used to make highly exact and fine cuts in
tissue. At the same time, it cauterizes severed blood vessels, thus sealing them and stemming blood flow. Extremely delicate operations, such as
eye surgery, have been made safer and faster by such exact treatment.

Endoscopy Not only does endoscopy have a diagnostic use, it has also made it unnecessary to ‘open up’ patients for certain surgical
procedures. Special tools can be attached to thin endoscopes, allowing surgeons to carry out surgery inside the body—sometimes through only
tiny incisions.

When more traditional surgery is required, it needn’t be at all dangerous or frightening. There have been significant discoveries and
improvements—a greater understanding of body tissues and the development of new materials, such as special plastics and carbon fibres.
Surgical implants can be carried out with a much greater degree of success. Where arthritis has led to joint damage, it is often possible to
replace an affected joint with an artificial one. Hip-joint replacement now lasts for ten or more years in 70 per cent of cases.

### Transplants

There have been remarkable developments in the field of transplant surgery. In the early days, only organ transplants between identical twins were
possible, because the body would only accept an organ that essentially matched the original. These days the problems of rejection have been
reduced by the development of various drugs. Kidney, heart and lung transplants are carried out every year, with varying degrees of success.
However, finding a suitable donor remains the first hurdle. Carrying a donor card means your organs could be used to give another person life in
the event of your death.

## **Alternatives**

Orthodox medicine is not the only way of treating ill health. There have been other methods in use for centuries. Many people have become
suspicious of orthodox medicine. There have been instances where great damage has been caused by ‘unsafe’ drugs prescribed before
sufficient testing has been done. Side effects of many major drugs may be as bad as or worse than the symptoms they were supposed to cure. It is
recognized that no medication is without side effects, however slight.

Most alternative medicines and therapies are seen as ‘kinder’ or ‘gentler’ treatments. It’s no longer fashionable to sneer at
alternative medicine—more properly called complementary or holistic medicine. It is usually the intention of such practitioners to treat the
whole person or the root cause of the disease—not only the symptoms.

Many so-called ‘primitive’ societies evolved complex systems of medical treatment, which have helped them for centuries. Most of these
were based on plants—valuable medical resources that are now at risk with the destruction of the habitat in which they grow. Herbalists
created many of the orthodox medicines used today—common drugs such as aspirin, some heart medicines and birth control pills are based on
‘natural’ substances. However, bear in mind that many off-the shelf herbal medicines in health-food shops have not been officially tested
or are not regulated because they are allowed to pass as ‘food supplements’. Some have proved dangerous.

Practitioners of alternative medicine often spend more time on diagnosis than is practical in the orthodox doctor’s surgery. This can be a
particular bonus when patients are suffering from stress-related disorders.

It is difficult to make sure that any alternative practitioners you consult have been properly trained—there are some charlatans about. Ask
about their qualifications and membership of the appropriate organizations. There is usually a national or regional ‘headquarters’ which
keeps a register of approved members. Look in your phone book or ask at a public library. Some forms of alternative medicine have little or no
scientific basis. This, however, does not mean that they won’t work for you. Some of the most popular are:

- Osteopathy and chiropractic treat joint and muscle problems by manipulation.
- Homeopathy treats diseases and disorders by administering small amounts of substances which, in healthy persons, would produce symptoms
    similar to those being treated.
- Acupuncture uses the insertion of needles through the skin to stimulate nerve impulses to treat the patient. Some conventionally-trained
    doctors now also use acupuncture.
- Acupressure uses pressure and massage in the same way as acupuncture uses needles (also known as shiatsu).
- Hypnotherapy uses hypnosis in the treatment of emotional and psychogenic problems. It is sometimes used to ‘cure’ the cigarette
    addict!

Many people choose these ‘alternatives’ over ‘conventional’ medicine. Others may investigate the possibility of these forms of
treatment only when they have a persistent, ‘incurable’ or terminal condition. This can sometimes lead not necessarily to a miracle
‘cure’, but at least to the alleviation of some symptoms. There is often a therapeutic value in just receiving caring attention.

## **Coping with illness**

When a serious illness has been treated, or an operation performed, you may be weak and ‘delicate’. If you have been told that your
condition is progressive or incurable, you may be deeply depressed or shocked. You may have been told—or have deduced—that your
lifestyle will have to change.

Even a minor operation might require lengthy recuperation that could interrupt your life and make demands on relatives and friends—the
people who care for you. In these situations you must seek support, you cannot face this crisis on your own. Other conditions-multiple sclerosis,
for instance—may pose long-term problems, with varying levels of assistance required as the illness progresses.

Professional counsellors are trained to help people deal with the changes in lifestyle that a health crisis can cause. Your condition may cause
you to feel acutely depressed. This can also be an ‘illness’—slowing recovery. There are support groups for almost every
condition—seek them out.

The spread of AIDS has helped to publicize the psychological effects of being a victim of illness. AIDS sufferers, but also victims of other
diseases, often find that they are rejected by the community—yet in most cases they pose no health risk from normal daily contact with
people around them.

People with illnesses or longer-term diseases need and must have physical assistance and emotional support, and may look to you to give it to
them. If your relative or friend is in this position, find out all you can about the illness, join a support group and DON’T be afraid to ask
for the help of others.

### Self-treatment

Do NOT attempt to ‘self-prescribe’ with over-the-counter medicines or vitamin and mineral supplements on a regular basis. Most
preparations have side effects of one sort or another, or can cause allergic reactions—either at once or by ‘acquired sensitivity’
over a period of time. If your diet is adequate and varied, supplements should be unnecessary. If you regularly take unprescribed medication for
pain (of any sort), for recurrent coughs and colds, or to regulate bowel movements, you may be harming yourself or masking the symptoms of a more
serious problem. You MUST seek medical attention ([see POISONS: The medicine cupboard)](/sas-urban/urban-poison#the-medicine-cupboard).

## **Recognize illness**

Although the best protection against illness is to look after yourself and stay fit, some risk of disease can never be eliminated. You may still
have to deal with a health crisis. While you may be able to cope at home with minor upsets (colds and flu, for instance), obviously there are more
serious conditions that will require medical assistance.

It would require several medical textbooks to cover every possible serious or worrying medical condition. This is only a general guide to
recognizing and dealing with medical emergencies. Without proper training, you cannot be expected to assess the seriousness of a condition, or to
make an accurate diagnosis—although some medical emergencies may be obvious.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Reading and committing to memory some of the information in this section could help you to save a life—at least help you to prevent
unnecessary suffering, if you recognize an illness quickly. Often, someone may be ill for days before a doctor is called!

:::

:::danger[Warning]

EMERGENCIES: Many illnesses, diseases and disorders may become life-threatening-some slowly, others very suddenly. If a person you know is
suddenly in great pain, collapses, convulses, vomits uncontrollably or runs a high fever, you shouldn’t hesitate to seek urgent medical
assistance or call an ambulance. They may have a previous history of illness or’ even a permanent health problem or allergy.

If the ‘victim’ is a stranger, it may be difficult to deduce what is wrong with them. If they are conscious, ask them if they know
what is wrong. They, too, may have a ‘permanent’ illness or condition-they may even carry a card or wear a bracelet to let everyone
know they have a serious health problem or are on regular medication. If the ‘victim’ is unconscious, search them quickly for any
evidence to suggest that they have a particular problem of this sort.

Unsteadiness, irrational or abusive behaviour, or collapse may suggest a person is drunk. It can also result from a serious emergency, such as
may occur in someone who is diabetic. If someone collapses, obviously from alcohol, place them in the
[recovery position](#recovery-position)(to keep the airway open). Don’t forget that anyone who is unconscious is at risk and
that alcohol can lead to severe poisoning and death.

:::

The intention in this section is to help you know when to call for help. If in any doubt—especially if someone is obviously very
ill—don’t waste time thumbing through a book. Pick up the telephone instead!

Seek medical attention indicates that the sick person should be seen by a doctor. You’ll have to decide whether to take them to the doctor, to
call the doctor to visit or to drive them to the casualty department of a hospital.

Seek urgent medical attention indicates that the condition may be more serious or even very serious. Don’t waste a single moment!

CALL AN AMBULANCE means just what it says. Do so, and then monitor the ‘patient’s’ condition or apply first aid ([see Save a life!](#save-a-life)) until the ambulance arrives.

## **Childhood diseases**

As soon as a child starts mixing with other children, at playgroup, nursery or school, he/she inevitably comes into contact with all the common
childhood infections. For two or three years there will be not only colds, tonsillitis, ear infections and so on, but the risk of catching the
well-known ‘infectious diseases’.

Many of these can be prevented if the child has been immunized against them. Parents should make sure to take their child to the clinic or doctor
at the correct ages, and that they keep a record of all the routine immunizations. Some of the diseases-for example, whooping cough in babies and
young children, polio at any age-can be very dangerous.

Immunization, whether by injection or by swallowing a drop of the vaccine on a lump of sugar (polio immunization) usually has few after-effects.
However, some may cause slight pain and swelling at the site of the injection, followed by mild fever (something like flu) and irritability.
Painkillers such as paracetamol (NEVER give aspirin to a child under twelve) can help. Sometimes, as in the case of measles, there may be mild
symptoms of the disease, which will pass quickly.

Some parents have been worried about the whooping cough vaccine because in a tiny minority of cases there has been brain damage following this
immunization. If you are concerned about this, talk to your doctor. Medical opinion favours immunization because whooping cough in very young
children can be a VERY serious disease, with much greater risks than those posed by the inoculation.

:::info[IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE]

AT 2, 3 AND 4 MONTHS  

- DPT (one injection)  
For diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus

- Polio (by mouth)  
AT 12-18 MONTHS  
Usually before 15 months

- MMR (one injection)  
For mumps, measles and German measles  
AT 5 YEARS

About the time of starting school  

- Diphtheria/tetanus (one injection)
- Polio (by mouth)

:::

### Chicken pox

Common infectious childhood disease. Not usually serious, but rare cases involve complications. Once you’ve had chicken pox, you are immune.
The virus is spread in airborne droplets. Infectious from about two days before a rash appears, to approximately one week after. The same virus
Herpes zoster can cause shingles in later life.

SYMPTOMS: Two to three weeks after contact, a rash appears behind the ears, in the mouth, armpits, on the trunk, upper arms and legs. There may
also be a dry cough. Within a day or two, rash resembles clusters of itchy red spots, which turn into fluid-filled blisters. These soon dry out to
become scabs. There may be a raised temperature.

**WARNING: In rare cases there may be complications, with coughing, vomiting and a high fever. If this occurs, or if the spots become inflamed, if
the eyes are affected or a severe headache starts, seek urgent medical attention.**

ACTION: Seek medical attention—a home visit is advisable. Treatment includes low doses of paracetamol to reduce fever and calamine lotion to
relieve itching. The child’s nails should be kept short. Scratching of the blisters and scabs should be discouraged, to prevent infection and
scarring.

**WARNING: Adults who have never had chicken pox should stay away from anyone who has got it (or away from any adults with shingles). Women in the
final stages of pregnancy should be especially careful—newborn babies can develop severe/dangerous attacks of the disease. Anyone who is
being treated for leukaemia or is HIV positive could be at great risk.**

SHINGLES: An adult person, who has had chicken pox, may contract shingles.

SYMPTOMS: Pain in the area of skin affected, then, about five days later, a rash. This starts as small, raised, red spots that soon become
blisters. After three days the blisters turn yellow, then dry and crust over. Within a couple of weeks the crusts fall off, often leaving small
scan.

ACTION: The sooner medical treatment with anti-viral drugs is given, the better the chances are of reducing the severity of the disease and nerve
damage.

**WARNING: Once the disease has passed its earliest stages, little can be done to relieve pest-herpetic pain. On the face, shingles is usually
confined to the eyelids and forehead, but can be extremely serious if the eyes are affected.**

### Measles

Viral illness which may be serious. Usually affects children, but can also occur in adults. In most cases, once you’ve had measles, you’re
immune.

SYMPTOMS: Fever, rash, runny nose, sore eyes and a cough. In four days, rash develops on the head and neck and spreads to the whole body. Lymph
glands may become enlarged. Symptoms start to disappear after three days.

ACTION: Seek medical attention-a home visit is advisable. In rare cases complications develop. Give low doses of paracetamol (NOT aspirin) and
plenty of drinks. Antibiotic drugs will take care of any minor, bacterial infections if these occur.

PREVENTION: Important, because of possible complications. The MMR vaccine is now routine.
[See Immunization schedule](#childhood-diseases).

**WARNING: Those with impaired immune systems, such as anyone with leukaemia or who is HIV positive, should keep away from children with measles.
This also applies to pregnant women—20 per cent of pregnant women with measles miscarry—though there is no evidence that the illness
causes any birth defects.**

### Mumps

Serious viral illness. Usually affects children, but may also occur in adults. Once you’ve had mumps, you are immune. 25 per cent of boys/men
who contract mumps (after puberty) experience inflammation of the testes (orchitis). If this occurs, one testis may be swollen and painful for a
few days and may shrink slightly when the illness passes. If both testes are affected, there is a slight chance of subsequent infertility. Women
may develop inflammation of the ovaries. In either sex, inflammation of the pancreas can cause abdominal pain.

SYMPTOMS: Usually develop gradually. A raised temperature, difficulty swallowing and pain behind the ears, leading to swelling of glands beneath
the jaw bone on one or both sides of throat. Swelling usually disappears after seven days.

ACTION: Most cases last a few days only. A doctor will make sure there are no complications. Give low doses of paracetamol (NOT aspirin, for
children under twelve) and plenty of fluids. Patient should rest in bed until symptoms have gone. If chewing is painful, soup is a good idea. The
main priority in severe cases of orchitis is to reduce the pain and inflammation.

PREVENTION: MMR vaccine is part of the routine immunization schedule. Boys (after puberty) and men should avoid infection if they have not had
mumps or been immunized against the illness. If symptoms of mumps do start to develop, an immunoglobin injection may offer a degree of protection
against orchitis.

### Polio

Infectious viral disease, which mainly (but not exclusively) affects children. Three closely-related polio viruses have been identified. Infected
people pass the virus in their faeces. Scrupulous hygiene is VITAL.

SYMPTOMS: Sore throat, mild fever, headache, vomiting and muscle ache are early signs of the minor form of polio and last for two or three days.
Only about 15 per cent of those infected go on to develop the major form of polio, in which the early symptoms are followed by chronic headache,
high fever, intolerance of light, a stiff back and neck, muscle pains and perhaps twitching, all caused by inflammation of the membranes covering
the brain and spinal cord (meninges). In rare cases, paralysis of some muscles occurs. This may lead to breathing difficulty and may even cause
death.

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention or call an ambulance. Although the majority of those who suffer the most serious kind of polio make a full
recovery, cases where paralysis sets in can be fatal and MUST be treated straight away. Hospitalization is VITAL, in case artificial respiration
may be needed. There is no effective drug treatment, but physiotherapy can aid recovery.

REMEMBER: Polio can be prevented by immunization at specified ages during childhood. As a result of routine immunization, polio is very rare in
industrialized countries, but still a risk in the Third World.

### German measles

Also called rubella. Common viral illness in children. Only a few similarities to measles. It is of importance as a severe risk to women in the
early stages of pregnancy. Once you have had rubella, you are immune.

SYMPTOMS: A rash of pink, slightly raised spots on the face, behind the ears and on the trunk and limbs for a few days. Glands, especially near the
back of the neck, may become swollen. There is often a fever and swollen—sometimes painful-joints.

ACTION: Paracetamol should reduce the fever, and fluids may be given to drink. If there is pain from the joints or glands, or the patient’s
temperature rises, call a doctor.

**WARNING: A pregnant woman should avoid ALL contact with anyone who has rubella. If she is exposed to the virus there could be severe consequences
for the foetus. Women who have not had rubella, and wish to have children, should be immunized against the virus. Pregnancy should not b be
considered until at least two months after the immunization.**

### Scarlet fever

Infectious disease, caused by an airborne bacteria. It is transmitted when the patient coughs. These days it is no longer a dangerous disease in
the UK.

SYMPTOMS: Sore throat, fever, headache and a rash, which begins as tiny red spots on the neck and upper body and soon spreads over the face. White
coating and red spots cover the tongue. A few days later the tongue is bright red. As the fever and rash start to subside, the skin on the hands
and feet may be flaky or peeling.

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention. Antibiotic drugs, such as penicillin, may be prescribed. Ensure plenty of rest and fluids. Paracetamol will
ease the fever.

### Whooping cough

Caused by an airborne bacterium, whooping cough (pertussis) can be fatal. Spread when the sufferer coughs. Usually affects small children and
babies. Most infectious before the ‘whoop’ of the cough has begun.

SYMPTOMS: Sneezing, mild cough, runny nose and sore eyes. Soon develops into bouts of coughing, usually with the characteristic ‘whoop’
sound. Symptoms may last for up to ten weeks, if not treated immediately.

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention, especially if a child vomits after coughing or appears to turn blue. Keep the patient warm. Give plenty of
fluids and small regular meals. Avoid exposure to cigarette smoke and draughts.

PREVENTION: Prevention is important, because of possible complications. These include dehydration and pneumonia, which are life-threatening to very
young children and babies, especially if premature. Infants should be immunized.

### Tonsillitis

Infection of the tonsils, causing throat and tonsils to become sore and visibly inflamed.

SYMPTOMS: Difficulty swallowing, fever, earache, headache, swollen and sore lymph nodes in the neck, and a bad taste in the mouth. Temporary
deafness may occur, or an abscess beside the tonsils (quinsy).

ACTION: If the symptoms do not clear in a day or so, or there is a severe infection, seek medical attention. Antibiotics may be necessary. Ensure
plenty of rest in bed, lots of drinks. Low doses of paracetamol (NOT aspirin) may relieve the fever.

## **Heart disease**

In many countries, heart disease is the leading cause of death among adult males—the incidence among women is increasing. About eight babies
in 1000 are born with a heart defect, usually as a result of the mother contracting German measles (rubella) during pregnancy ([see Childhood diseases](#childhood-diseases)) or as a complication of Down’s syndrome.

The most common form is ischaemic heart disease, leading to a narrowing or obstruction of the coronary arteries which supply blood to the heart
muscle. Chest pain (angina pectoris)—caused by lack of blood supply to the heart muscle-is brought on by severe stress or exertion, but may
be relieved by rest. Unremitting chest pain may not be due to angina, but to a myocardial infarction (‘heart attack’).

See a doctor immediately if you suspect any sort of heart trouble. Early treatment is VITAL. Prevention and treatment of heart disease include
improving the diet—eating less animal fat and salt—exercising and stopping smoking/drinking.

### Heart attack

When a section of heart muscle ‘dies’, it is known as a myocardial infarction.

SYMPTOMS: Overpowering, relentless pain in the chest, shortness of breath, giddiness, profuse sweating, irregular pulse, blue skin and lips,
vomiting and possibly collapse and unconsciousness.

Cardiac arrest means that the heart has stopped pumping. It may be caused by myocardial infarction, hypothermia (dramatic heat loss), drug
overdose, electrocution, severe blood/fluid loss, or anaphylactic shock (acute allergic reaction).

SYMPTOMS: Sudden collapse, unconsciousness, no pulse, but initially would still be breathing. Monitor breathing closely and be prepared to apply
artificial respiration.

**WARNING: The response to both a myocardial infarction and a cardiac arrest should be to CALL AN AMBULANCE. It is VITAL to act quickly to avoid the
risk of possible brain damage. While you are waiting for medical help to arrive, give [cardiac compression](#cardiac-compression) and
artificial respiration ([see Save a life!](#save-a-life)).**

### Hypertension

Unusually high blood pressure (measured in the main arteries), even when resting. Most people’s blood pressure is increased as a response to
exercise and in times of stress, but decreases when they are resting.

SYMPTOMS: There may be no symptoms. If the hypertension is severe, there could be shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness and problems with the
eyesight. Antihypertensive drugs can be used for severe cases or as a last resort, but self-help measures are the preferable option.

PREVENTION: Many people have hypertension without knowing it. For this reason, it is important to have regular medical check-ups. The condition
affects up to 20 per cent of adults, particularly middle-aged men. To some extent it can be avoided by stopping smoking, stopping drinking, losing
weight (if overweight), decreasing animal fat and salt intake, and exercising regularly. Unchecked, hypertension may lead to heart failure, heart
disease, damage to the kidneys or the eye retina (retinopathy).

## **Cancer**

Over one in four people are affected by cancer during their lifetime. It is known to cause over 140,000 deaths every year, in the UK alone, and
(after heart disease) its the second most common cause of death in the Western world.

An abnormal growth or lump in the body is not necessarily cancerous (malignant)—most growths are benign. When cancerous cells in organs or
tissues do occur, they may destroy or disturb circulation, bones, nerves and tissues. Cancerous cells sometimes travel rapidly through the system
to form new tumours elsewhere in the body.

Whether or not a person develops cancer is largely determined by their genetic make-up. Cancer-causing agents may trigger the disease. Cancer has
been linked to many factors, including diet, smoking, drinking alcohol, occupational hazards and the use of food additives. Sexual/reproductive
history can also prove an influencing factor in the incidence of cancer in women. Cervical cancer has been linked to number of sexual partners,
for example, whereas motherhood whilst comparatively young may lessen the likelihood of breast cancer.

Australia has a high incidence of people with skin cancer. Those most at risk in the northern hemisphere are pale-skinned holiday makers, who
expose themselves to the sun in short bursts ([see IN TRANSIT](/sas-urban/urban-in-transit)).

### What to watch for

The earlier the diagnosis, the higher the chance of a cure-80 per cent of breast lumps turn out to be benign. The cure rate for testicular cancer
in its early stages is between 95 and 100 per cent. Cancer produces a range of symptoms. Any of the following signs should be reported to a doctor
immediately, if they persist for several days or more.

- Changes in breast shape or ‘lumps’.
- Unexplained nipple discharge.
- Menstrual bleeding, unrelated to periods or menopause.
- Development of lumps or changes in the scrotum.
- Constant unremitting pain in the abdomen.
- Bleeding (painless) during urination.
- Persistent problems with bowels/defecation.
- Throat problems (especially when swallowing).
- Unexplained grating or husky voice.
- Heavy cough with blood in the phlegm.
- Regular headaches.
- Mysterious and swift loss of weight.
- Sores or ulcers which do not heal.
- Moles which grow or constantly itch.
- Lumps or patchy changes in skin condition.

In recent years, the means of diagnosing cancer at an early stage and the range of treatments available have dramatically improved. Screening
tests, microscopic examination of cells by biopsy, scanning and imaging techniques all give VITAL diagnostic information and cause little
discomfort to the patient. Almost half of all cancers may now be cured. The survival rate, for the years after diagnosis, continues to
increase-although it does depend on the part of the body affected.

### Leukaemia

Name for forms of cancer in which there is an overproduction of white blood cells from the bone marrow. This inhibits or disturbs the manufacture
of normal red and white blood cells. As these invade various organs in the body, other problems may develop-especially in the spleen, lymphatic
system, liver or brain.

SYMPTOMS: ‘Sore’ bones, bleeding gums, recurrent headaches, unexplained bruising, pale complexion, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes (in groin,
neck and armpits), recurrent infections (including coughs and sore throats).

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention. Depending on the type of leukaemia, antibiotic or anticancer drugs, radiotherapy, or bone marrow transplant
may be used.

## **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**

A progressive disease which affects the central nervous system, causing the destruction of areas of the covering (myelin) of the nerve fibres in
the brain and spinal cord.

MS has an enormous variety of symptoms, ranging from numbness and tingling in the limbs, to paralysis and incontinence. General symptoms include
fatigue, apparent clumsiness, ‘loss of balance’, visual disturbances and muscle weakness. There are often dramatic and unpredictable
improvements and relapses—a patient may be severely disabled one week and seem normal the next.

Relapses are more common after injury, infection and physical or emotional stress. The patient may be left with mild symptoms for long periods of
time, or even no symptoms at all. Tragically, some people may be severely disabled or even paralysed in their first year of illness.

Research to find a cure continues. Some people with MS believe that changes in their diets, including reducing the intake of starch and increasing
sunflower or evening primrose oils, can help. As yet, no drug has been found to help all MS victims, although some drugs alleviate specific
symptoms. Perhaps the most beneficial treatment is physiotherapy, which strengthens muscles and restores mobility and independence.

## **Epilepsy**

A disorder which can lead to occasional losses of consciousness. Convulsions may occur. The condition may be ‘inheritable’. Seizures may
be triggered (for instance) by injury or severe illness. There are two main types of epileptic seizure—general (grand mal) and absence
(petit mal).

### General seizure

SYMPTOMS: Having fallen to the ground unconscious, the victim will firstly go rigid, then start to twitch involuntarily. Their breathing may be
erratic or stop totally. After the victim’s muscles relax—bladder and bowel control may be lost. He/she may be confused, may feel very
drowsy, and usually cannot remember the event.

ACTION: Carefully loosen tight clothing around the neck. Move anything which might cause harm—especially to the victim’s head. NEVER
restrain the victim or place anything in the mouth. NEVER attempt to move the victim unless in danger of injury. When the attack is over, place
the victim in the [recovery position](#recovery-position) ([see SAFETY FIRST](/sas-urban/urban-safety-first)) and allow him or her to regain
consciousness.

WARNING: Seek urgent medical attention. CALL AN AMBULANCE if seizure continues for more than five minutes, if another seizure follows or if
consciousness is not regained a few minutes after the seizure has ended. Prolonged seizures can be fatal without immediate emergency treatment.

REMEMBER: Epileptics should advise their colleagues on what to do if a seizure occurs and carry a special card or bracelet stating that they have
epilepsy. Statistics suggest that the condition may be worse in childhood and adolescence. Many people ‘grow out’ of the condition, or
find that medication helps to keep it under control.

### Absence seizures

A temporary loss of consciousness for up to thirty seconds during which the epileptic is oblivious to his/her surroundings, appearing to be
daydreaming. The attack may even pass without anyone noticing. There may be many ‘attacks’ in a day, especially in children, and
schoolwork could suffer.

## **Diabetes mellitus**

A disorder in which the body does not manufacture the hormone insulin in sufficient quantities, if at all. Insulin controls the way the body
regulates sugar levels in the blood. This condition may be present from birth, although it may manifest itself at any time during a diabetic’s
life.

SYMPTOMS: Excessive thirst, Constant need to pass urine. Weight loss, fatigue and hunger, caused by the body’s inability to use or store
energy-giving glucose. Blurred vision, muscle weakness, tingling and numbness in the hands and feet. Recurrent skin infections, candidiasis
(thrush), and urinary tract infections such as cystisis. Most diagnosed diabetics can usually treat themselves—but may need help.

WARNING: If a ‘diabetic’ or someone suspected of having diabetes seems in distress and unable to help themselves, Seek urgent medical
attention or CALL AN AMBULANCE. Without regular insulin injections, the sufferer may lapse into a coma and die.

### Diabetic emergency

Two main conditions can occur. Hypoglycaemia—too little sugar in the blood—can rapidly cause a life-threatening condition.
Hyperglycaemia—too much sugar in the blood—normally develops slowly and the diabetic is prepared for the problem.

SYMPTOMS: Low blood sugar may cause the diabetic to appear dizzy or drunk and aggressive. He/she may look pale and sweating. Breathing is shallow.
There may be trembling and a rapid pulse, possibly with rapid loss of consciousness. The diabetic may or may not be aware of the problem.

ACTION: If you are quick, it may only be necessary to give the casualty a sweet drink, sugar or chocolate to raise the blood sugar level. If the
diabetic lapses into unconsciousness, seek urgent medical assistance.

WARNING: Diabetics who have been taking insulin for quite a few years may have few warning symptoms that they are slipping into hypoglycaemia. An
overdose of insulin may be extremely dangerous. Diabetics should not miss meals or eat only tiny snacks. Low blood sugar levels, if allowed to
persist, can cause brain damage. It is possible for the condition to lead to coma and death. If you know a diabetic, discuss the situation so that
you will know how to help if a problem arises.

## **Genetic disorders**

There are many diseases and disorders which are passed on from generation to generation through families. Some genetic defects may not be apparent
until the person is mature—others may be evident at birth. Some traits, such as colour blindness, do not usually cause any real disability.
Others, including haemophilia or sicklecell anaemia, may be life-threatening.

Traits for genetic disorders may be carried by either parent. Sometimes, through mutation of the genetic material, a child can be born with a
disorder that has never been seen in the family before. Whatever the origin of the condition a person may inherit, it may directly affect their
health, their fitness and susceptibility to disease throughout their life.

When considering having children, couples with known genetic disorders, or who have genetic problems in their family history, should seek medical
advice about the likelihood of disorders occurring in their children.

The couple may find professional counselling of great help. This is obviously an emotionally-traumatic situation and professionals are able to
help with the short- and long-term problems that may arise. They are also in a position to provide support over time and instigate communication
with many counselling groups.

This is by no means a comprehensive list of ‘inheritable’ diseases—but indicates how serious and complex they may be.

### Cystic fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis may be evident from birth, although it may not be detected for months or even years. It is caused by a defective gene. The main
manifestations are repeated infections of the lungs and the failure of the body to make use of food. A child may ‘fail to thrive’. A
sticky mucus secretion, may be present in the nose and throat, the air passages and sometimes in the intestines. Faeces may be pale, shapeless and
strong-smelling. Males and females may later suffer from infertility.

Early diagnosis and treatment are VITAL to avoid complications like pneumonia, bronchitis and lung damage. Antibiotic drugs and physiotherapy can
be of great help.

A special protein-rich, high-calorie diet should be devised with added vitamins to encourage the digestive system to function more normally.
Current medical care means that, although there is still a risk of permanent lung damage, the quality of life for those affected is now far higher
than it would have been a few years ago.

### Haemophilia

A disorder caused by a deficiency of a blood protein, known as factor VIII, which is essential to blood clotting. Haemophilia is the result of a
defective gene, carried by females but almost always passed on to males.

Haemophiliacs tend to experience recurrent bleeding, not always caused by injury, usually into the muscles or joints. Bleeding episodes may be
painful, although the severity varies greatly.

Early diagnosis and control of severe bleeding episodes is vital to avoid crippling deformities of the joints. Bleeding is usually controlled with
concentrates of Factor VIII, either as a preventative measure or as treatment when bleeding has just started.

Being a genetic disorder, it’s quite likely that a haemophiliac will have a close male relative also suffering from the condition (although in
a third of cases there is no history of it). Haemophiliacs and their female relatives should seek genetic counselling before starting a family.
Haemophiliacs should avoid strenuous contact sports and opt instead for gentler forms of exercise, such as walking and swimming.

### Huntington’s chorea

A rare inherited disorder affecting the central nervous system, manifesting itself in middle age. There is a 50-50 chance that a parent may
transmit the relevant gene to a child.

When the condition becomes apparent, walking, speaking and hand movements gradually become difficult. Spasmodic and jerky movements may escalate,
possibly followed by mental deterioration and severe behavioural problems—often requiring hospitalization.

There is no known treatment, though tranquillizers may calm the nervous system. Genetic counselling is essential for those at risk, if they intend
to start a family.

### Muscular dystrophy

A muscle disorder of unknown cause. Muscular dystrophy may appear at birth, in infancy or as late as the child’s fifth or sixth year. The most
common form is duchenne muscular dystrophy, the result of a recessive gene that is carried by females and passed to males.

Once the disorder becomes apparent, there may be a slow but progressive degeneration of the muscle fibres. It is usually diagnosed by the
patient’s appearance and movements.

As yet there is no ‘cure’ for muscular dystrophy, although many cases benefit from surgery to the heel tendons to improve walking ability.
The affected person should be encouraged to remain physically active, to keep healthy muscles in ‘working order’. They should avoid
becoming overweight. The parents and brothers or sisters should seek counselling before having more children or starting a family.

### Sickle-cell anaemia

A blood disease, occurring mainly in black people and, sometimes, in people of Mediterranean origin. It causes the red blood cells to become
abnormal, resulting in a life-threatening form of anaemia. In the UK alone, about one in 200 people of West Indian origin and one in 100 of West
African origin have the disease. Approximately one in ten has the trait (in other words, carries the disease), which may be passed on when two
carriers have a child.

The first signs—shortness of breath after exertion, jaundice, pallor, headaches and fatigue—may appear after the age of six months.
The symptoms may be triggered by a childhood illness, dehydration as a result of prolonged diarrhoea and vomiting, or very cold weather.

Sickle-cell anaemia attacks various parts of the body. Children may experience pains, ‘tender’ bones, and blood in the urine from kidney
damage. Brain damage may cause seizures, unconsciousness or stroke. Some children may develop a life-threatening form of anaemia. From puberty
there is a risk of blood poisoning, if the spleen stops working. There is also an increased risk of pneumonia. Treatment includes immunization
against pneumonia, and penicillin, antibiotic drugs, painkillers and folic acid supplements.

People who do not know whether or not they carry the sickle-cell gene MUST find out. A couple who both carry the gene or have the disease should
obtain counselling before having children. Although the survival rate in under five-year old is still poor, improved methods of treatment have
increased the chances of longer-term survival. Thirty years ago the disease was usually fatal to children. Today, some sufferers are able to have
children of their own.

## **Back/joint pains**

The most common causes of ‘time off work’ are musculoskeletal strains, which include back pain and sports injuries. These warrant a visit
to the doctor and may be soothed by painkillers and alleviated by physiotherapy. Some resolve themselves, spontaneously. Most back strains can be
avoided, by not overstraining when lifting heavy weights—keep your back straight and bend your legs when you must move weighty objects.

### Rheumatoid arthritis

More common in women than in men, it may begin insidiously and can lead to joint deformity. Most of the connective tissues may be affected, but
the worst damage is usually done to the joints.

SYMPTOMS: Stiffness, pain and swelling in the small joints of the hands and feet, followed by problems with the larger joints, such as hips and
knees. There may be diminished movement of the joints and muscle wasting. Tissues round the joint may become inflamed. Many of the internal organs
may be affected, including the lungs, heart, kidney and eyes. The central nervous system is also at risk.

ACTION: Seek medical attention to reduce the pain. Anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy and (very rarely) steroids may help. The best advice is
to start treatment early to head off the risks of disability.

### Osteoarthritis

Affects almost everyone past the age of 65. There is a degeneration of the joint surfaces, especially where there has been a previous injury or
deformity. The incidence increases with age and obesity. Women tend to be more prone to the disease than men.

SYMPTOMS: Pain is induced by movement, particularly in the evenings. Small joints of the hands are the first to become affected, in most cases, but
may be followed by pains in the spine, knees and hips. As the condition progresses, there may be stiffness, immobility and even joint deformity.

ACTION: Reducing the pain is the first priority. It may be necessary to use a walking stick or walking frame to reduce pressure on the joints. If
the feet are affected, there are special shoes which may make walking easier. If overweight, weight loss would be advisable. In serious cases,
joints may be fused or replaced surgically.

## **Respiratory problems**

Respiration is the process by which oxygen reaches body cells and carbon dioxide is emitted from the body. Although it may seem simple, it
involves a highly complex set of organs which are prone to disease, damage and infection. Respiratory disorders can affect the air passages,
causing obstruction, or affect the lung tissues.

If there is no apparent external cause for severe breathing difficulties—airborne dust, fumes or a crushing injury—there are several
other immediate possibilities. If the victim is not actually choking ([see Save a life!](#save-a-life)) and does not have a history of
respiratory illness, seek urgent medical attention, especially if blood is coughed up. The cause may be:

Oedema: A dangerous build-up of fluid in the lung. This is most likely if the person is already ill with heart disease or kidney failure. Certain
drugs, such as steroids, or hormone therapy may also cause fluid misplacement in the body. Seek urgent medical attention.

Pulmonary embolism: Severe difficulty in breathing, dizziness, sharp pain in the chest when breathing, blood coughed up, rapid pulse rate may
indicate that a small blood clot is restricting the flow of blood between the heart and lungs. Tends to affect women—after pregnancy or
after surgery. Seek urgent medical attention.

Ventricular failure: Most likely to occur when there is a severe problem with the heart, causing fluid to build up in the lungs. The heart would be
treated first in this sort of emergency. Seek urgent medical attention.

### Asthma

Bronchial asthma is a very distressing condition, normally associated with childhood-although it may persist into adulthood. Characterized by
recurrent attacks of breathing difficulty, usually with wheezing. Most asthmatics have their first attack when they are small children—but
it is possible for asthma to develop later in life.

SYMPTOMS: Include mild or acute breathlessness, panicky wheezing, apparent inability to breathe in, coughing, sweating, inability to speak, rapid
pulse and great anxiety. In rare cases, the attack may be severe enough to cause a blue facial pallor. Such an attack may be life-threatening.
Seek urgent medical attention.

ACTION: Most asthmatics carry medicines, usually in the form of an inhaler. They may need help to use the inhaler. It consists of a small aerosol
with a mouthpiece. It is usually necessary to take two full puffs. The drug should dilate the constricted bronchioles in the lungs in 15
minutes-allowing air to enter the lungs. If the attack has been unusually severe, seek medical attention.

REMEMBER: Some forms of asthma may be due to external causes, such as breathing in a harmful substance or a substance to which the person is
particularly sensitive. There may not be any history of attacks. Many asthmatics have common allergies, such as hay fever or sensitivity to house
dust. Attacks may be brought on by anxiety, stress or sudden emotional upset. Most ‘grow out of’ the condition by their early twenties.
Even if the condition persists, there are very effective therapies and treatments.

### Pneumonia

Inflammation of the lungs due to an infection, usually carried by viruses or bacteria.

SYMPTOMS: Chills and fever, breathlessness and a cough with greeny-yellow phlegm or sometimes blood. It may be difficult or painful to take air
into the lungs. This may be due to inflammation of the lining of the chest and lungs (pleurisy).

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention. Mild pneumonia usually responds well to antibiotic or antifungal drugs, depending on the cause of the
infection, with paracetamol to reduce the fever. In some cases, particularly if the victim is elderly, hospitalization may be necessary.

### Tuberculosis (TB)

Tuberculosis is still a major problem in the Third World. It is an infectious bacterial disease—the bacterium is transmitted when the person
sneezes or coughs. The immune system usually stops the infection, but scar tissue may be left in the lungs. In a small minority of cases the
infection is more serious and may spread to other parts of the body. In these cases, further tissue damage may occur-especially to the lungs.

SYMPTOMS: Pain in the chest, a heavy cough, breathlessness, loss of appetite, loss of weight and a sweaty fever which may be worse at night.

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention. If not treated early, the bacteria occasionally lie dormant in the lungs and other organs of the body, to be
reactivated years later. Provided the full course of treatment is followed, most victims fully recover.

### Hyperventilation

Usually caused by extreme anxiety, hyperventilation takes the form of excessively deep or rapid breathing. Can also be caused by kidney failure,
oxygen deficiency and diabetes.

SYMPTOMS: Over-breathing reduces the carbon dioxide in the blood, making it more alkaline, which tends to increase feelings of anxiety—making
the problem worse.

ACTION: Breathing into a paper bag for a while should help to restore carbon dioxide to the blood. Even when the attack has passed, seek medical
attention.

PANIC ATTACK: Sudden, often unexplained, attack of acute anxiety. The main outward signs are often hyperventilation, heart ‘palpitations’,
sweating, shivering, fainting and tearfulness. Given the effect hyperventilation can have on anxiety levels, the victim should be encouraged to
breathe into a paper bag for a few moments while being calmed and reassured as much as possible. Attacks may be related to work, the home, crowds,
public transport, being outside. Recurrent panic attacks may be symptoms of certain phobias and it is these phobias which should be treated.
Attacks usually pass after a few minutes and, although very unpleasant, usually do no actual physical harm. Seek medical attention. There may be a
help-group or counselling group which could provide support.

### Bronchitis

Inflammation of the bronchi, the airways that connect the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs. Acute bronchitis may start suddenly but not last very
long. Chronic bronchitis lasts longer and may recur over several years.

SYMPTOMS: Persistent coughing, large quantities of yellow or green phlegm, wheezing, breathlessness, discomfort in the chest and, in acute
bronchitis, fever.

ACTION: Seek medical attention. Antibiotic drugs will help to treat or prevent a lung infection. In the case of chronic persistent bronchitis, a
doctor will check that any blood coughed up is not a result of a more serious lung problem

PREVENTION: The most common cause of bronchitis is a history of smoking. Those who are subject to bronchitis, especially chronic bronchitis, would
be extremely foolish to continue to smoke. Passive smoking, that is, being in an environment of cigarette smoke, may also lead to bronchitis.

## **Eating disorders**

Every time we switch on a television or open a magazine, we are confronted with images of slim healthy people with perfect teeth and perfect
lives. Young people, especially teenage girls, are particularly susceptible to this onslaught. At a time when their bodies are changing in a way
they cannot control, young people may find that they can control their figures. They may begin to starve themselves for long periods of time
(anorexia nervosa), or overeat in binges and then force themselves to vomit (bulimia nervosa). Both are dangerous. Seek medical attention.

Obesity is in many ways the opposite of anorexia nervosa. Very overweight people consume far more in calories than their bodies are able to
convert. If they do not have a network of friends or family to offer emotional support, people may resort to ‘comfort eating’, or
deliberately gain even more weight as an expression of unhappiness.

An overweight person, as well as someone who appears to be healthy, may be suffering from malnutrition. A diet of ‘fast’ or convenience
foods, chocolate bars and potato crisps, coupled with a social life based around restaurants and public houses, will not provide the balanced diet
necessary for good health. The health of anyone, whatever their weight, will suffer. If you do live on pre-packed sandwiches and convenience foods
or skip meals altogether, a multivitamin and mineral supplement may be advisable. Consult a doctor.

### Anorexia nervosa

SYMPTOMS: Severe weight loss, with great lengths taken to avoid food. Anorexics may lie to their families, saying they have eaten out so that they
can miss meals. Extreme choosiness over food, excessive exercise, use of laxatives, ‘baby’ hair on body, thinning of head hair and absence
of menstrual periods. Anorexics often refuse to or are unable to recognize their thinness.

ACTION: Anorexia nervosa is difficult to treat and in rare cases may prove fatal. Hospital treatment is usual to help the person return to normal
weight. He/she will often require psychotherapy for some time. Full recovery is possible. Under stress, relapses may occur. Doctors should be able
to suggest self-help organizations which can be very supportive of former anorexics.

### Bulimia nervosa

Bouts of overeating followed by self-induced vomiting. Bulimia nervosa often starts as anorexia nervosa—in both there is a fear of becoming
fat. Mainly affects girls and women between the ages of 15 and 30.

SYMPTOMS: Bingeing and vomiting may occur more than once per day. In extreme cases this may lead to tooth decay from gastric acids, dehydration and
loss of potassium causing weakness and cramps. Bulimics may take laxatives to help ‘drive’ food from the body. They are not always very
thin and may be of normal weight. They may be distressed about their compulsive behaviour, depressed or, in extreme cases, suicidal.

ACTION: Treatment is required to supervise and regulate eating habits. Sometimes psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs are used. Full recovery is
possible, but there is a risk of relapse.

## **Food hygiene**

In recent years there have been well-publicized scandals connected with the food we eat—salmonella in eggs, for instance, and listeria in
soft cheeses. Mass production of food may sometimes put profit before quality. Food-hygiene legislation is not always strict enough or properly
enforced. The result is that food poisoning has increased—particularly in urban areas.

Take care to store and prepare food carefully in your home. Bacteria need food, warmth, moisture and time to multiply. They cannot grow on dried
or dehydrated foods, which are safe until rehydrated. Bacteria thrive at 37&deg;C (98.6&deg;F)—body temperature—multiplying every two
to 20 minutes. Danger zones are between 5&deg;C and 63&deg;C (40&deg;F to 145&deg;F). Normal room temperatures are within this range, so avoid
leaving food out of the fridge for too long. A fridge thermometer will give a very accurate temperature reading.

:::info[BE SAFE, NOT SORRY]

Simple food hygiene measures can virtually eliminate the risk of poisoning or contamination:

- Always wash your hands before and DURING food preparation-especially after handling meat and poultry, rubbish bins and after using the
    lavatory.
- Always rinse cutting boards and utensils after each type of food, to avoid cross-contamination, especially of raw and cooked meats.
- Always wash fruit and vegetables thoroughly in clean water.
- Throw away anything that smells or looks spoiled, bulging or rusting tin cans, any food that has passed its sell-by/use-by date, mussels
    that do not open when cooked.
- Make sure that frozen poultry is completely thawed before use, and then well-cooked.
- Keep refrigerators between 2&deg;C and 5&deg;C (35&deg;F and 40&deg;F).
- Keep freezers at - 18&deg;C (-0.4&deg;F). Check the temperature of refrigerators and freezers regularly with a thermometer.
- Heat food such as soups and pies to a temperature of at least 63&deg;C (145&deg;F).
- Do not reheat food more than once.
- If using a microwave, check that food is cooked all the way through.
- Never leave foods such as butter, cheese and meats at room temperature.
- Never keep cooked and uncooked foods together.
- Change dishcloths and tea-towels every day.
- Never allow pets, their hairs or cat litter on to work surfaces, especially if there is a pregnant woman in the house.
- Do not wrap cheese and other fatty goods in cling film (it contains a possibly dangerous chemical which may leach into fats).
- Babies, toddlers, pregnant women and the elderly should not eat eggs, unless these are cooked until both the whites and yolks are solid.
- Never brush or spray hair in the kitchen or near food; if your hair is long, keep it covered or tied back.
- Never smoke whilst preparing food.

### Animals and food hygiene

Animals and food hygiene do not go together. Domestic pets and pests can cause diseases ([see Pets and your health](#pets-and-your-health)). Mice or rats can be detected by droppings, damaged packaging, spilled foods and broken eggs.

Mice are not usually a serious threat to health, but they are unhygienic. They are attracted by fallen scraps of food, so floors should be kept
clean. Humane traps, which capture mice alive, can be used to reduce numbers, but mice tend to move around houses under floors, through wall
cavities and roof spaces, and are therefore difficult to eradicate completely. Call your local environmental health officer or a-specialist if the
problem persists.

Rats pose a serious health risk and are increasingly prevalent in cities. They can be killed using anticoagulant poisons, but should be dealt with
only by a specialist.

Bats are generally harmless to humans in temperate zones. Indeed, they are a becoming increasingly rare and are a protected species. It is illegal
to interfere with them, or their nests. Call your local authority for advice.

Cockroaches may pose serious health risks—they may carry salmonella and hepatitis in their faeces. A severe infestation may be difficult to
remove. Seek expert assistance.

### Food poisoning

When a naturally poisonous substance or contaminated food has been swallowed, it is VITAL to pinpoint the source. There are many poisonous
mushrooms, toadstools and poisonous plants ([see here](/sas-urban/urban-poison#poisonous-fungi)). Vegetables and fruit that are normally safe
may be contaminated by high levels of pesticide or fertilizer. Food may have been incorrectly stored or prepared. Sometimes, symptoms may develop
rapidly or they may appear over a couple of days.

SYMPTOMS: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pain. Possibly shivering and fever. If infection is severe, there may be a risk of shock or
unconsciousness.

ACTION: Mild cases of food poisoning can be treated at home. Give plenty of liquids, with a small amount of salt and sugar—but nothing to
eat. Most cases clear within three days. If in any doubt, seek medical attention.

WARNING: If diarrhoea/vomiting is especially severe, or if victim collapses or has difficulty in swallowing/speaking, seek urgent medical
attention. Do not induce vomiting as a way of removing infected foodstuff. If the poisoning is severe, it is helpful to keep samples of the
suspected meal or vomit for tests help pinpoint the cause. Other people may be at risk.

### Bacterial poisoning

SALMONELLA This name covers a group of bacteria. Commonly associated with raw chicken, eggs, raw meat and seafood. Symptoms usually develop within
24 hours. The young and elderly are particularly at risk. If a baby is affected, it may be vital to replace lost body fluids. Anyone who has had
salmonella food poisoning should bear in mind that-for several months after the symptoms disappear—they may excrete the bacteria in their
faeces. Consequently scrupulous hygiene should always be practised.

TYPHOID Caused by one of the salmonella bacteria-Salmonella typhi. Associated with food or water contaminated by sewage. Alternatively flies or
cockroaches may carry the bacteria to food. Shellfish exposed to sewage may be another risk. Any case of typhoid MUST always be reported to the
local health authorities in industrialized societies—where the disease has become very rare ([see Tropical diseases](#tropical-diseases)).

LISTERIA Listeria monocytogenes is a very common bacterium. Humans may be exposed to it from salads, chilled food which is heated for eating,
badly-cooked meat, soft cheeses. It can multiply in chilled food in a refrigerator if the temperature is not law enough—one important reason
for observing sell-by and use-by dates. The infection—known as listeriosis—may be very serious and can kill very young children, the
elderly and anyone with a depressed immune system. Pregnant women may be at risk.

STAPHYLOCOCCUS Even proper cooking may not destroy toxins caused by various strains of ‘staph’. The most likely cause is from septic sores
on the hands of the person preparing food. Symptoms usually occur within two to six hours.

BOTULISM Rare, but associated with incorrect canning or preserving of food. The spores of the bacterium are resistant to cooking. Although rare in
most developed countries, this is a very serious form of poisoning. Symptoms (apart from the symptoms mentioned earlier) usually develop within
two days and include difficulty swallowing and disturbed vision. Early treatment is essential.

## **Tropical diseases**

Many diseases of tropical areas are linked to inadequate hygiene and geographical factors such as temperature and humidity. Malnutrition may
contribute to the spread of disease, because it lowers the body’s ability to fight infection. Many of these diseases were once also common in
temperate zones, but have been eliminated by improvements in public health and hygiene—in particular keeping water and soil free from
contamination.

It’s worth bearing in mind that many tropical diseases are very localized. Sleeping sickness, for example, an extremely serious parasitic
disease spread by the tsetse fly, only occurs in areas of Africa. The malaria map of the world is constantly changing and, what’s more,
mosquitoes can become resistant to the preventative drugs. That’s why you should always get your doctor to check the most up-to-date medical
information for the region you intend to visit.

Vaccinations should be obtained before travel to tropical areas, but note that these only offer partial protection—other precautions, such
as food and water hygiene, must also be observed scrupulously. Avoid uncooked food. Take insect-repellent sprays, a mosquito net to use at night
and long-sleeved clothing and socks to protect exposed skin. For information on risk zones and special immunizations
[see IN TRANSIT](/sas-urban/urban-in-transit).

### Cholera

Infection of the small intestine, caused by food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Cholera is prevalent in Africa, the
Middle East and Far East. Cholera can only be controlled worldwide by improving sanitation and ensuring that contaminated water does not come into
contact with drinking water. Major epidemics tend to follow natural disasters, especially in crowded conditions or if few people are left to nurse
the sick.

SYMPTOMS: Profuse watery diarrhoea and vomiting. Can lead to dehydration.

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention. If the diarrhoea is severe, the victim may dehydrate rapidly and die. Lost fluids should be replaced by
plenty of liquid, to which has been added salt and sugar at one level teaspoon of salt/eight level teaspoons of sugar in one litre (about two
pints) of water. Most patients make a full recovery, but some may need hospital treatment if dehydration continues despite fluid replacement.

PREVENTION: Travellers to risk areas should obtain a cholera vaccine (which usually lasts for six months). Boil all drinking water or buy it from
reliable sources.

### Dengue

Viral disease spread by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Southeast Asia, Africa, the Pacific region and South/Central America are all risk areas.
Outbreaks known in Mexico, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

SYMPTOMS: Rash, headaches, fever, extreme muscle and joint pains. These initial symptoms tend to subside after a couple of days, only to reoccur.
It may take some weeks for a full recovery to be made, although serious complications are rare.

ACTION: There is no ‘cure’ for dengue and no vaccine. Painkillers may be needed to relieve the symptoms. Steps should be taken to avoid
being bitten by mosquitoes in the first place—wear protective clothing (particularly at dawn/dusk) and use insect-repellent sprays and
mosquito nets.

### Malaria

Serious disease spread by the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is a major health problem in the tropics. It affects 200 to 300 million
people worldwide and kills over a million people every year in Africa alone.

SYMPTOMS: Symptoms usually appear within two weeks of being bitten, but may not appear for up to a year if the victim has taken antimalarial drugs
inconsistently. Symptoms are fever with chills and shaking, with three stages. At first, the patient may be cold, with uncontrollable shivering.
The temperature may then rise to 40.5&deg;C (105&deg;F). There may be profuse sweating, which helps bring the temperature down. All these symptoms
may be accompanied by severe headaches, malaise and vomiting. After the fever attack the patient may be weak and exhausted.

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention. This is an emergency and may require admission to hospital. Antimalarial drugs and, in severe cases, blood
transfusions may be given.

PREVENTION: Antimalarial drugs should be taken by all visitors to the tropics, including pregnant women. Wear clothing that covers legs and arms in
the evening. Insect repellent sprays and mosquito nets all reduce the likelihood of being bitten.

### Typhoid fever

Acute, highly-infectious disease affecting the digestive tract, caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi. Paratyphoid is milder and caused by the
bacterium Salmonella paratyphi. Both are contracted from contaminated food or drink, and are more common in hot climates than in temperate areas.

SYMPTOMS: Headache, aching limbs, fatigue, fever lasting several days, then subsiding and returning a few days later. Constipation and mental
confusion accompany the fever. Later diarrhoea, bloating of the abdomen and red spots on chest and abdomen may occur.

ACTION: This is an emergency. Seek urgent medical attention as soon as salmonella poisoning is suspected. Treatment is likely to include
antibiotics, rehydration and hospitalization—usually in isolation.

PREVENTION: Scrupulous hygiene in handling food. Avoid shellfish from possibly contaminated waters. Eggs, which have recently been identified as
carrying the bacteria in some cases, improperly thawed frozen poultry and some ‘cook-chill’ foods must all be thoroughly cooked to destroy
the bacteria. Immunization against typhoid and paratyphoid lasts several years.

### Typhus

A group of infectious diseases caused by micro-organisms that are similar to bacteria (rickettsiae). Usually spread by insects such as fleas,
mites and ticks.

SYMPTOMS: Headache, constipation, collapse, pain in the back and limbs and coughing Followed by fever, mild delirium and a rash of small red spots.
There may also be a weak heartbeat.

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention. Prompt treatment may help to avoid death from septicaemia (blood poisoning), heart failure, kidney failure
or pneumonia. Part of the treatment may include antibiotic drugs. Convalescence is often slow, especially for elderly people.

PREVENTION: Insecticides to control louse infestation, vaccination and protective clothing may all discourage bites from tyhpus-carrying insects.
Preventative measures are important in crowded tropical conditions and after a natural disaster.

### Yellow fever

Infectious disease transmitted in urban areas by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Some types may be spread from monkeys to humans. Yellow fever is
prevalent in Africa, Central and South America.

SYMPTOMS: Nosebleeds, headaches, nausea and fever. Heartbeat may be slow, despite the fever. Recovery usually takes place within three days. In
severe cases there may be pain in the back, neck and legs. Rapid liver damage may lead to yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and kidney failure. In
untreated cases, these may be followed by mental disturbances or delusions, then coma and eventually death.

ACTION: There is no effective drug. Treatment involves maintaining the volume of blood in the body, often by transfusion. Most people recover
before the disease progresses. Once you’ve had it you’re immune.

PREVENTION: Vaccination should be sought by travellers to risk areas, except for babies under a year old. A vaccination certificate is required for
entry into or exit from some countries where the disease is prevalent.

### Plague

Plague killed 25 million people, in Europe alone, in the 14th century. Today it is responsible for up to 50 human deaths each year, mainly
confined to parts of Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. Caused by the bacteria Versina pestis and spread by the bites of fleas that have
lived on dead rats. There are two types—bubonic, characterized by swollen lymph glands or ‘buboes’, and pneumonic, which affects the
lungs. Both must be treated IMMEDIATELY or will almost always prove fatal.

Travellers to high-risk areas should NEVER touch a rat or the carcass of any animal or bird. A vaccine is available for people in high-risk
occupations.

## **Stds**

Sexually-transmitted diseases are infections spread primarily, in a majority of cases, by sexual intercourse, heterosexual or homosexual.
Confidential diagnosis and treatment is given at STD clinics, where a doctor will assess the infection or infections-usually prescribing a course
of antibiotic drugs. Tests are usually made after the symptoms have gone, to ensure that the patient no longer has the infection.

From the late 1970s it became clear that some STDs, such as herpes (which can become chronic) and hepatitis B (which can be fatal), could not be
cured with drugs. With the recognition of the HIV virus and AIDS in 1982, STDs became even more life-threatening.

All recent partners of an infected person should be traced by an STD clinic, especially since these contacts could be infected with a type of
sexually-transmitted disease which shows no obvious symptoms. The confidential tracing and treatment of anyone who has had recent sexual contact
with the person being treated is essential to the control of STDs.

## **Safer sex**

Sexual intercourse is only completely safe if both you and your partner have never had sex with anyone else and if neither has ever had an STD
(which could have been contracted non-sexually). Safe sex was traditionally practised by anyone wishing to avoid contracting any STD, but is now
IMPERATIVE with the recognition of HIV and AIDS. To reduce the likelihood of contracting any STD you should:

- Never have unprotected sexual intercourse, except with a monogamous partner whose sexual history and HIV status is known to you.
- Always use a condom and spermicidal jelly. Novelty condoms (coloured, flavoured, or textured) tend to be less reliable than the thicker
    varieties. Remember that oil-based lubricants like petroleum jelly and baby oil can damage the rubber. Water-based lubricants should be used.
- Reduce the number of your sexual partners.
- Remember that prostitutes have a high rate of infection. They should ensure that their clients use a condom, to protect both the client and
    themselves.

:::danger[Warning]

Sex is a high-risk activity unless it is made ‘safe’. NEVER have penetrative sexual intercourse with a casual partner without using a
condom (see Safer sex). Couples wishing to have children should seek medical advice.

:::

### High-risk sex

Transference of body fluids may lead to transmission of STDs or HIV, if one or more partners carry them:

- Unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse. Remember that secretions will still be exchanged even if the unprotected penis is withdrawn before
    ejaculation.
- Any sexual activity that draws blood from the genital area or breaks or chafes the skin.
- Putting the fingers (aggressively), hand or object into the vagina or rectum before, during or after sexual intercourse. This may damage the
    lining of the vagina or rectum and increases the risk of STD/HIV transmission.

### Low-risk sex

Little or no risk of STD or HIV transmission:

- Oral/genital contact. The risk is increased if the woman is menstruating or the man ejaculates into his partner’s mouth.
- Oral/anal contact. Infections such as gonorrhoea can be passed on in this way.
- Sharing ‘sex toys’.
- Putting one or more fingers (gently) into the vagina or anus.

### Very-low-risk sex

Minimal transfer of body fluids:

- Penis/body contact or vagina/body contact.
- Mutual or group masturbation.
- Sex toys used with, but not shared with, a partner.
- Urination in sex.

### No-risk sex

No transfer of body fluids:

- Masturbation on your own.
- Sex toys used on your own and not before vaginal or anal intercourse.
- Touching or massaging, not in the genital/anal area.
- Bondage or beating. Breaking the skin increases the risk.

### Aids

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is not a single disease, but a group of infections and cancers caused by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).
AIDS has an extremely high fatality rate, but the number of people infected with the HIV virus who go on to develop the condition is statistically
very low. HIV is believed to be a life-long infection, which can manifest in a variety of ways-from no symptoms at all to severe damage to the
immune system. This means that the body has only limited protection from the diseases and infections it may come into contact with.

SYMPTOMS: Minor symptoms of HIV infection include inflamed skin, particularly on the face, rapid weight loss, diarrhoea, fever and oral candidiasis
(thrush). Diseases that tend to be more acute in HIV-infected patients include shingles, tuberculosis and herpes simplex infections. The brain may
also be affected, causing disorders like dementia. Full-blown AIDS includes various cancers, diseases of the immune system, pneumonia, diarrhoea,
candidiasis and chronic or persistent herpes simplex.

ACTION: Diagnosis for AIDS is based on a positive result to an HIV test (note that there is no such thing as an ‘AIDS test’), along with
the presence of characteristic infections and tumours. So far, there is no cure or vaccination against the disease, although research continues.
According to the form their illness takes, patients respond in varying degrees to antibiotic drugs, antiviral drugs, anticancer drugs and
radiotherapy.

REMEMBER: The most useful treatment for anybody with HIV infection or AIDS is practical help with their everyday lives, if and when they need it,
and reassurance and companionship. Bear in mind that it is the person with AIDS who is in danger—infections such as measles and chicken pox
have serious consequences because of the deficient immune system. Normal non-sexual human contact poses NO risk to the non-infected person.

AVOIDING AIDS There are only three ways to contract HIV infection:

- Sexual contact, especially unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse. Not all sexual activities carry a risk.
- Mother to baby, before and perhaps during childbirth. Very rarely, HIV antibodies can be transmitted by breastfeeding.
- Shared needles and syringes. This includes sharing needles to inject drugs, use of medical equipment for more than one patient and, in rare
    cases, the re-use of acupuncture, tattooing and body-piercing needles without proper sterilization.

In the past, HIV is known to have been transmitted through blood transfusions, and blood products to treat haemophiliacs. Today, all donated
blood, semen and organs are meticulously screened for HIV and any of the infections and blood products are heat-treated. Nevertheless, people in
high-risk groups should NOT donate blood, semen or organs such as kidneys.

REMEMBER: The HIV virus is not transmitted through insect bites, coughing or sneezing, cuddling, dry kissing,
[mouth-to-mouth](#mouth-to-mouth) resuscitation, nor by sharing lavatory seats and household utensils, such as drinking glasses,
crockery and cutlery.

HIGH-RISK GROUPS People most at risk of contracting HIV infection are:

- Promiscuous men and women, particularly if they have numerous sexual partners without using condoms.
- Men and women who believe they are not at risk and have casual sexual intercourse without using condoms.
- Prostitutes, and their clients, if they do not use condoms.
- Subsequent partners of both of the above.
- Intravenous drug users and their partners (male or female).
- Bisexual or homosexual men and their partners, if they have causal sexual intercourse without using condoms.
- Hospital patients who receive unscreened blood transfusions or blood products-including haemophiliacs—although treatment of blood and
    blood products should now rule this out.
- People who undergo surgery in some Third World countries, where equipment may be scarce and must be re-used.
- People who have unprotected casual sex in areas where there is a very high incidence of HIV infection, such as central Africa and Haiti (and
    most major cities).

REMEMBER: Anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to HIV can request a blood test. However, it would be wise to obtain counselling to
determine whether you really need to have the test done and how to prepare yourself for the news of a positive result. Also bear in mind that you
may have to wait at least three days (perhaps a lot longer) for the result.

Because the HIV virus takes time to manifest itself in a detectable form, someone who has only recently come into contact with the disease may
have a negative result in an HIV test and consider themselves free of the disease—but they may be positive. Those in high-risk groups should
follow a negative result with another test about six months later. Some people who are HIV positive do not develop full-blown AIDS for several
years—others remain HIV positive, but do not go on to develop AIDS.

If you are HIV positive or have AIDS, you will have to be monitored every three months or so to check that the T-cells (the helper white blood
cells) are at a safe level. You can help to keep the number of T-cells high by eating well, exercising and making sure that you get plenty of
rest. For practical help, advice and friendship contact your local AIDS help group.

### Candidiasis

Also known as thrush. A fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. It affects moist body tissues such as mucous membranes, especially in the
vagina but also penis, anus or mouth. Candidiasis, as an STD, is transmitted by sexual contact with an infected person. When antibiotic drugs are
taken or when the body’s resistance to infection is lowered (after or during a serious illness, for example), the fungus may multiply rapidly.
Candida albicans is usually found in moist body tissue—it’s only when it gets out of control that a problem develops. It can also spread
from one moist body area to another and can sometimes affect the gastrointestinal tract.

SYMPTOMS: Vaginal candidiasis commonly appears as a thick white discharge that takes the appearance of cottage cheese. May be accompanied by
itching and discomfort on passing urine, although some women have no such symptoms. Penile candidiasis is quite rare, and is more likely to infect
an uncircumcised penis, causing inflammation and soreness under the foreskin. Oral candidiasis may appear as creamy-yellow sensitive patches
anywhere in the mouth. In babies candidiasis takes the form of an irritating rash with white flaky patches in the general nappy area.

ACTION: Seek medical attention. Vaginal pessaries or creams containing anti-fungal drugs are usually required. These should be applied to the
affected areas as directed. It is recommended that sexual partners are treated at the same time, to prevent reinfection. Women who suffer
repetitive bouts and who take oral contraception should consider changing to another, non-hormonal type. Oral candidiasis should be treated with a
special mouthwash. In most cases, candidiasis is relieved ‘cured’ very quickly and simply, but tends to return. Areas prone to infection
should be kept clean and dry.

### Cystitis

By no means classed as an STD, but may be linked to infections caused by sexual intercourse—or may be mistaken for an STD. An inflammation
of the lining of the bladder, usually caused by bacterial infection. In women, bruising of the urethra caused by over-enthusiastic intercourse can
also lead to cystitis. Recent research has cast doubt on the safety of vaginal deodorants and bubble-baths. Both may lead to irritation and
cystitis. Links are being explored with bladder cancer.

SYMPTOMS: Burning or stinging pain when passing urine, frequent urge to pass urine but with only small amounts passed, cloudy or bloody urine,
chills, fever and nagging pain in the lower abdomen.

ACTION: Seek medical attention. Drink large quantities of water to flush out the bladder, but not excessively to the point where you feel ill.
Drinking water with a teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate about four times a day will increase the alkalinity of the urine—anyone with high blood
pressure or heart trouble should consult their doctor first. Painkillers may help, but do not take over-the-counter remedies for more than 48
hours. If symptoms persist seek medical assistance again, as cystitis may spread to the kidneys. Pregnant women are particularly at risk from
kidney infections. Prompt treatment with antibiotic drugs will usually settle the infection within 24 hours.

REMEMBER: Women who have repeated attacks of cystitis should urinate as soon as possible after sexual intercourse. Sometimes similar symptoms may
be caused by a sexually-transmitted infection-if you have had a recent change of sexual partner or if your partner develops similar symptoms, see
your doctor or visit an STD clinic.

### Herpes

Not necessarily an STD but the general name for a group of viruses, of which herpes zoster ([see Chicken pox](#chicken-pox)) and herpes
simplex are the most significant. Herpes zoster is also the virus which causes shingles. Most people carry HSV1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) and
may develop cold sores and, in some cases, genital herpes. HSV2 more commonly leads to genital herpes.

SYMPTOMS: Pain, burning or itching in the affected area, followed by the development of sore red skin eruptions or blisters, which burst to form
small painful ulcers. In a severe attack, glands in the groin may become swollen and painful, and there may be a fever. There may be pain on
passing urine if the tip of the penis or the vagina are affected. The sores may appear anywhere on the body, provoked (it is believed) by stress,
poor health, illness with fever, even by overheating in the sun.

ACTION: Seek medical attention. There is little or no treatment, except to avoid disturbing the sores-the virus is highly contagious. If the sores
become infected, antibiotic drugs may be prescribed. Anti-viral drugs may be prescribed in severe cases. Kissing or sexual contact should be
avoided during an attack, and for a week afterwards.

WARNING: A severe attack may be life-threatening, especially if the eyes or the brain become affected. Seek urgent medical attention. A baby might
become infected, if the mother has an attack at the time of childbirth. People who are HIV positive should avoid all forms of herpes, if possible.
The consequences could be severe.

### Genital warts

Soft warts which grow in and around the anus or the vagina, or on the penis. Genital warts are caused by a virus and spread through sexual contact
with an infected person. However, it may take as long as twelve months after the initial contact for the warts to appear.

ACTION: Seek medical attention. Genital warts are usually painless and can be removed by simple surgery or the application of ointment, but tend to
recur. Some may spontaneously disappear. Sometimes, however, clusters of warts may develop, causing great discomfort.

REMEMBER: Links are suspected between genital warts and cervical cancer ([see Cancer](#cancer)). This makes doubly important the need
for cervical smear tests for any woman who has had genital warts.

### Gonorrhoea

Also known as ‘the clap’, it is spread primarily by sexual intercourse (including vaginal, anal and oral sex) and from mother to baby
during childbirth. It is one of the most common STDs and, once detected (incubation period is less than two weeks), can usually be ‘cured’
very quickly and simply. Current safe sex practices (using condoms) should reduce the incidence statistics—if they are followed?

SYMPTOMS: Discharge from vagina/penis and pain on passing urine. More than half of women infected have no symptoms. If the anus is infected, the
rectum and anus may become inflamed and a discharge may be apparent on the faeces. After oral sex a ‘sore’ throat may develop. In babies
it causes an inflammation of one or both eyes.

ACTION: Seek medical attention. Antibiotics, usually penicillin, are administered. After treatment, further tests confirm eradication of the
infection. Sexual partners are normally traced confidentially through STD clinics and told they may have gonorrhoea to prevent reinfection or
spreading of the disease.

WARNING: Gonorrhoea must be treated as early as possible to prevent it from spreading to other parts of the body. In men, it may cause inflammation
of the testes and prostate, affecting fertility. In women it can spread to the fallopian tubes and cause pelvic inflammatory disease, with a risk
of a misplaced (ectopic) pregnancy. It can also affect female fertility. If untreated gonorrhoea is allowed to spread through the system, a form
of arthritis may develop-leading to painful and swollen joints. There may also be chronic blood poisoning which (very rarely) can affect the major
organs (brain and heart) and lead to death.

### Nonspecific urethritis (NSU)

An inflammation of the urethra, which may not have an identifiable cause. Most cases are caused by bacteria or viruses. This is the most common
type of STD worldwide, affecting men and women.

SYMPTOMS: In men, there may be a clear or pus-filled discharge and pain on passing urine. Symptoms are sometimes absent. In women, there are
usually no symptoms unless there are complications.

ACTION: Tests are made to identify the cause of the infection, but this can be difficult as there are so many possible causes. For women, diagnosis
often relies on the fact that a partner has the condition and may have passed it on. Both partners should be treated with antibiotics. Most cases
can be ‘cured’, but infection/symptoms commonly recur. Follow the full course of medication and seek further attention if the problem
persists.

### Pubic lice

Also known as crab lice or ‘crabs’. An infestation of Phthirus pubis—a small insect that lives at the base of pubic hairs and feeds
on the host’s blood. They are very easily transferred during sexual contact. [See colour pages](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#pubic-lice).

SYMPTOMS: Pubic lice are usually felt (as pinching or itching) and seen (as small dark ‘spots’). The females lay tiny eggs which are also
visible to the naked eye. On hairy men they may also be found in body hair, on the legs, arms and even on the face or head. Parents may transmit
lice to their children. It is said that, if exposed to cold air or water, one can feel the lice ‘tighten their grip’?

ACTION: Seek medical attention. Insecticide lotion containing benzyl benzoate or lindane (to kill eggs as well) should be applied. More than one
treatment may be required to kill all the eggs. Sexual partners should also be treated. Clothes, sheets and blankets should be washed in very hot
water.

REMEMBER: Other body parasites such as scabies, and fungi such as ringworm, may be spread by sexual contact.

### Syphilis

Usually transmitted sexually during intercourse, less commonly by kissing, mutual masturbation or by contact with items soiled by an infected
person. Traditionally viewed as life-threatening, syphilis responds well to antibiotics—although the sooner it is recognized, the better.
Syphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, which has access through breaks in the skin or through membranous tissues of the genitals,
anus or mouth. Since mothers-to-be are now screened, congenital syphilis is rare.

There is a 30 per cent chance of contracting the disease after contact with an infected person.

SYMPTOMS: Three to four weeks after contact, a painless ulcer with a wet base, up to 1cm (&frac12;in) across, appears on the site of the
infection—genitals, anus, rectum, lips, throat, and sometimes on the fingers. This heals within four to eight weeks. At six to twelve weeks,
there may be a skin rash. in white people this takes the form of noticeable crops of pinkish round spots. In black people, the rash is pigmented
and appears darker than the surrounding skin. Other symptoms include fever, fatigue, headaches, ‘aching bones’ and loss of appetite. Scalp
hair may fall out. Infectious pinky-grey patches can develop on moist skin areas.

Latent syphilis: This stage of the disease may persist for years or even indefinitely. The infected person appears to be quite ‘healthy’,
but a few cases (if untreated) may lead in time to tertiary syphilis.

Tertiary syphilis: This stage can take as many as 25 years to develop—perhaps as few as three. The effects will vary from one individual to
another. Tissue death or breakdown of any parts of the body may occur. Other effects of tertiary syphilis include cardiovascular syphilis (which
can lead to heart valve disease) and neurosyphilis (with progressive brain/spinal cord damage and general paralysis).

ACTION: Seek medical attention. All stages of the disease respond to treatment with penicillin, but any organ damage (which only occurs in the
later stages)is irreversible. As treatment begins, there may be flu-like symptoms and tender lymph nodes. Regular check-ups should follow to
confirm that the infection has been dealt with. It will show up (harmlessly) in the blood for many years.

REMEMBER: The first and second stages of the disease are infectious, the latent and tertiary stages are not. Measures to avoid contracting syphilis
include practising safe sex. Confidential contact tracing means that others who may have become infected can be informed and treated. Some may
have no symptoms and may spread the disease, unwittingly, to others.

### Hepatitis b

Viral disease, resulting in inflammation of the liver. It may be extremely serious, with damage to or death of liver cells. People in obvious
high-risk groups—those with many sexual partners, intravenous drug users and their partners, prostitutes and their clients, doctors and
nurses—should seek advice. There is a vaccine available.

SYMPTOMS: Begins as a flu-like illness (which may be severe and debilitating) and leads eventually to jaundice-yellowing of the skin. In rare
cases, if not treated, liver failure may occur, leading to death.

ACTION: Treat as a very serious illness. Seek urgent medical attention.

WARNING: A baby born to a carrier mother may be at severe risk. Antenatal screening is advisable. There is no risk from contaminated blood
products. Blood is screened and/or heat treated to remove the risk.

## **Parasites**

Numerous organisms may live in or on humans. Not all spend their entire life with the host-some are just ‘passing through’! Some bring
serious diseases, whereas others may cause few noticeable symptoms.

About 30 protozoa may ‘inhabit’ humans-many causing serious conditions such as amoebic dysentery, malaria and toxoplasmosis. Fungi are
fairly simple parasites and may only cause simple skin infections, such as ringworm. Others may invade the lungs or other body tissues and lead to
serious illness or even death.

Many bacteria are essential within the human body, others are ‘invaders’ causing diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis and skin
disorders. Many are well-known and deadly—salmonella, for example.

Even viruses are parasites. There are many types of virus-the smallest known disease agents (about 100th the size of the smallest
bacterium)-leading to some very well-known illnesses from the common ‘cold to warts, from rabies to viral hepatitis, from AIDS to
polio—and all the common childhood diseases from mumps to measles. Immunization programmes exist to combat many viruses.

### Worms

Many people are embarrassed by the very idea of having ‘worms’, but most humans have at least one type of worm in their lifetime. These
may live in the gut, in bile ducts, or in blood vessels. Many produce eggs which are excreted by the host.

Liver flukes infest the bile ducts of the liver and have a bizarre life cycle. They normally infest sheep and lay eggs which are excreted in the
faeces. The eggs are then eaten by snails, hatch and emerge as immature flukes which are passed on to water flora—including watercress.

In the Far East, liver flukes may be ingested by humans in raw or undercooked freshwater fish. In the early stages of infestation there may be
rashes, night sweats, liver enlargement and tenderness. Later, jaundice may develop.

The largest types of tapeworm usually occur in regions where there is inadequate sewage disposal and unhygienic preparation of meat for food.
Animals may play intermediate host, humans ingesting the larvae from undercooked meat. The largest tapeworms may be 9m (over 29ft) long! They
attach themselves to the wall of the intestine and trail throughout it.

The dwarf tapeworm is only 2.5cm (1in) long and found worldwide, especially in tropical regions, and is usually caught from an infected person or
in insanitary conditions. The eggs pass out in faeces and may be ingested by hand-to-mouth contact. In central and Western Europe, Australia and
New Zealand there is a rare but serious illness involving cyst formation in the lungs and other tissues. The cause is the larva of a small
tapeworm, which relies on sheep and dogs to complete its life cycle.

Roundworms such as threadworms and hookworms are fairly common worldwide. Many cases of infestation don’t cause any noticeable symptoms,
unless there are large numbers of worms.

Threadworms are very common, infecting as many as one in five children. They are about 1cm (less than 3/8in) long. Their eggs are laid in the skin
around the anus, causing severe itching. Scratching may detach the eggs, which are then transferred back to the mouth. Keep children’s
fingernails short and encourage good hygiene. Wash underclothes and nightclothes at high temperatures to kill eggs and worms, and seek medical
attention.

Hookworms are more common in tropical regions, infesting an estimated 700 million people. The larvae burrow into the skin of the feet, travel to
the lungs, from where they are coughed up and swallowed, to mature in the gut to about 12mm (&frac12;in) long. They may cause anaemia.

### External parasites

External parasites, such as lice and mites, may be passed from one human to another. Ticks may be picked up from animals or vegetation. Seek
medical attention in all cases. Eradication of most parasites is usually simple and quick.

There are three main types of lice—all are about 3mm (&frac14; in) across-infesting specific areas: the head, the body, the pubic region.
Head lice ([see here](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#human-lice)) suck blood from the scalp, causing itching and soreness. ANYONE can
get lice, particularly children. Nowadays lice are NOT to be associated with poverty or lack of body hygiene. In fact, lice find it easier to
cling to clean hair. Eggs (known as ‘nits’) are commonly attached to the base of hairs.

Body lice are (unfortunately) associated with dirty clothes and can (in warmer countries) transmit serious diseases such as typhus. Clothes should
be washed in very hot water or burned.

Pubic lice seek the warm soft pubic areas but may migrate to other hairy body areas, including the head. Known as ‘crabs’, they are most
frequently transmitted during sexual contact (see [STDs section](#stds) and [this link](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#pubic-lice)).

Bedbugs are flat, wingless insects about 3&times;5mm (1/8&times; 1/4in). They live in furniture and bedding, or cracks in walls and floors nearby,
and emerge at night to feed on humans. Their bites may be visible and itchy, and may lead to infected sores. Seek medical attention.

The numerous types of mite are all tiny. Some transmit serious diseases such as typhus, others are fairly harmless to most people. A severe house
dust allergy can usually be traced to an allergy to the faeces of dust mites—millions live in EVERY home in carpets and bedding, where they
feed on tiny flakes of human skin.

Others, such as the scabies mite, live IN human skin-they are highly contagious. The burrows look like small scaly grey lumps—often on the
hands, in the armpits, around the genitals, leading to reddened patches on the limbs and torso. Usually all members of a household need to be
treated at once—but treatment is almost always effective immediately, although the irritation may take a couple of weeks to subside.

Mites known as ‘chigoes’ may be picked up in grassland, scrubland or beaches in Africa or tropical America. Also known as
‘jiggers’ or ‘chiggers’, the mites usually penetrate the skin of the feet or lower leg. They are actually sand flies and harvest
mites. The females burrow into human skin to lay their eggs. Treatment usually involves removing the creatures with a needle and the application
of antiseptic ointment.

## **Pets and your health**

Zoonoses are infections or diseases of animals that can be transmitted to humans—-some zoonotic organisms are able to adapt themselves to a
variety of different species. Zoonoses are most commonly associated with pets and livestock (obviously because these animals coexist closely with
humans), but are also known to be transmitted to humans by wild animals, such as rats.

In addition to zoonoses, there are many examples of human diseases which can be spread by vectors-animal carriers. Rat fleas were responsible for
spreading the Black Death, the 14thcentury plague that claimed 25 million lives in Europe alone. Nowadays, rats (or their fleas) still spread
diseases such as plague, typhus, Weil’s disease and Lassa fever.

There are known to be about 30 animal diseases which may be transmitted to humans-a few of these from household pets. Some have extremely serious
consequences.

### Pets

Pets and domestic animals are generally beneficial to our health. Cats and dogs provide companionship and it has been proven that stroking an
animal can be therapeutic for the owner, reducing tension and, in some cases, lowering blood pressure. Dogs have to be taken for walks, providing
exercise for their masters (whether you like it or not!). Specially-trained dogs can help the deaf and blind.

Any pet that, is properly cared for and in good health presents no threat, provided these guidelines are followed:

- Wash your hands whenever you have touched pet food, faeces, urine, or cat litter.
- Provide separate dishes, utensils and can-opener for pets.
- If a pet has diarrhoea or seems ‘off colour’, be scrupulous about hygiene.
- Take a pet to the vet whenever it is ill.
- Arrange regular worming and flea treatments.
- Wash your hands before you eat, drink or smoke, if you have been playing with or stroking an animal.
- NEVER allow an animal to lick your face, however much it may seem to be an expression of ‘love’.
- DON’T allow young children to play with soil-especially if dogs or cats use the area as a ‘lavatory’. This includes public play
    areas, where dogs are exercised.

### Pregnancy and pets

Infections from domestic animals have access through the placenta to the foetus. This can result in miscarriage or severe malformation. If a woman
becomes infected with certain diseases in late pregnancy, the child may be subject to disorders of the nervous system or blindness—although
symptoms may not show for a few years. Pregnant women should:

- NEVER change cat litter trays or come into contact with animal faeces
- NEVER handle dog or cat food-especially raw meat
- NEVER stroke stray cats or dogs
- NEVER handle soil

### Allergies

Some people develop allergies to dog or cat dander, the tiny scales from animal skin and fur that are present in the air and make up a large
percentage of household dust. This can cause asthma or urticaria (a type of skin rash), sneezing, itchy eyes-all may be slight or severe. REDUCE
contact with the animal concerned and seek medical attention.

:::danger[Warning]

TOADS ARE DANGEROUS: NEVER allow small children to play with toads. The toad’s skin secretions are highly poisonous and can enter the body
through the mouth, by sucking lingers with poison on them or through a break in the skin. The poison can affect the heart, cause convulsions
and even lead to death.

:::

## **Zoonoses**

### Cat scratch disease

Not a common occurrence. A cat bite or scratch may lead to blistering and swelling, occasionally to an abscess. The infection progresses possibly
causing headaches, fever and swelling of the lymph nodes. The exact cause of this infection has only been identified recently. The disease does
not imply that the animal is ill. Seek medical attention.

### Cryptosporidiosis

A protozoic infection leading to nausea, fever, abdominal pain and watery diarrhoea—in children, the elderly or anyone with a suppressed
immune system (as is the case with people suffering from AIDS) it may be life-threatening. Can be transmitted by animals or humans. Treatment
includes rehydration. Seek medical attention.

### Hookworm

Mainly confined to tropical and sub-tropical regions, this parasite can be transmitted from infected pets by skin contact with larvae. There are
no long-term health risks, but an itchy rash may occur on the skin, especially on the feet. Serious infestation may lead to lung problems,
abdominal pains and anaemia. High-risk areas: places where cats and dogs defecate—playgrounds, beaches, parks. Seek medical attention.

### Lyme disease

Only identified in 1975, this condition is caused by a bacterium which is transmitted by a tick which lives (normally) on small birds, rodents and
deer, but which will bite dogs and humans. Symptoms include joint inflammation, lethargy, fever, aches. Unless treated, these may persist for
several years. In rare cases, serious complications may develop, affecting the heart and the central nervous system. High-risk areas where ticks
may be ‘picked up’ include scrubland, woodland, areas of long grass—especially if deer are present. The condition is known to occur
in Europe and the northeastern United States. If Lyme disease is suspected, seek urgent medical attention.

### Pet throat

Over a third of all domestic pets carry a streptococcal bacterium which causes sore throats. Persistent or recurrent sore throats in a household
with pets should always be investigated. Seek medical attention. DON’T allow pets to lick your face.

### Psittacosis

Usually transmitted by caged birds and causing a variety of symptoms, including fever, headaches, a bad cough, sore throats, lethargy, breathing
difficulties, and rashes.

The bird may show no signs of ill health, or may show signs of ornithosis. Avoiding dust from droppings, feathers and actual contact with birds is
essential. In rare cases, if untreated, psittacosis can be debilitating or even fatal. Anyone who has contact with birds as pets, as a hobby or
for a living, should monitor their health and seek urgent medical attention if a problem develops.

NOTE: In recent years, links have been investigated between bird-keeping and a greatly increased rate of lung cancer.

### Rabies

Transmitted by infected saliva from animal bites and caused by a virus that attacks the central nervous system. Over 12,000 cases are reported
annually worldwide. Rabies is extremely rare in Great Britain, Australia, Scandinavia and Japan. It is endemic in countries where quarantine laws
are relaxed, especially in parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, the United States and South America, where it may be carried by wild dogs, foxes,
wolves, badgers and vampire bats. Cases from domestic dogs are rare.

SYMPTOMS: May not appear until months after infection. Fever, agitation, delirium, weakness or paralysis, extreme salivation, difficulty swallowing
and brain inflammation. Fear of water (hydrophobia) may set in, followed by coma and death.

ACTION: If a bite does occur, especially in these regions, the animal should be isolated for observation. The bite must be inspected by a doctor
IMMEDIATELY. Seek URGENT medical attention. A vaccine is available, given as a course of injections over several weeks. Other infections may also
be transmitted by an animal bite.

### Ringworm

Although the name suggests a worm, this is a popular name for a group of common fungal skin infections, which can be transmitted by pets, from one
human to another, or from infected soil or household objects. Symptoms include ring-shaped, red, scaly or blistery patches on the skin. Seek
medical attention.

Eradication involves the use of anti-fungal powders, creams and drugs. Reinfection is common. Hygiene must be scrupulous.

### Toxocariasis

Potentially VERY serious infection caused by infestation by the larvae of the common dog roundworm (also lives in cats). Eggs of these parasites
are passed by dogs (and cats) into soil. The eggs can remain viable for several years. Humans-most commonly children-are infected when playing
with an infected dog or in infected soil.

Once the eggs hatch in the body, the larvae migrate to the liver. Early symptoms may include abdominal discomfort, mild fever, throat infections,
nausea, coughing or wheezing—often not severe enough for infestation to be suspected. Complications can develop, leading to convulsions,
behavioural changes, and—if larvae migrate to the eye-impaired vision or eventually blindness. If this condition is suspected, seek URGENT
medical attention.

WARNING: Dogs MUST be wormed on a regular basis (consult a vet). Young children who play with dogs or in gardens/parks where dogs may defecate are
AT RISK. Recent surveys have found that soil in most public parks is severely contaminated. The eggs are NOT destroyed by cold weather. Care
should be exercised by EVERYONE who handles soil. When gardening, for example, avoid hand-to-mouth contact.

### Toxoplasmosis

Potentially VERY serious infection. Humans may be affected (and often are) by eating infected pork or lamb, although the protozoa responsible for
the infection may live in several species. More seriously, the organism can multiply in a cat’s intestines and eggs are then excreted in cysts
within the faeces. Humans may become infected by touching the cat, or handling a litter tray or soil contaminated by cat faeces.

In healthy humans the infection manifests itself only with flu-like symptoms, although eye inflammation may also occur. However, in pregnant
women, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy, the risk of infection must be avoided AT ALL COSTS. There are severe risks to the foetus,
including abortion and stillbirth. Babies may be born with abnormalities ranging from anaemia (and other blood disorders) and enlargement of the
liver or spleen, to an enlarged head, brain damage, blindness, deafness. In some cases the baby may appear normal but may develop severe problems
in the first two years—including eye, ear and brain diseases.

Anyone with a suppressed immune system (especially anyone suffering from AIDS) must also take great care to avoid infection. The consequences
could be devastating-possibly leading to complications involving the lungs, heart and brain.

WARNING: Always wear gloves or wash your hands thoroughly after handling a cat, a litter tray, cat’s faeces, raw meat or soil. ALWAYS dispose
of cat litter trays carefully and promptly. Toxoplasmosis is an EXTREMELY common infection worldwide.

### Weil’s disease

Properly called leptospirosis. Human infection may occur from contact with the urine of infected rats-a possibility when swimming or enjoying
other watersports in city rivers, dockyards or canals. Dogs may also be infected. Symptoms of human infection include fever, chills, headache,
muscular pains, rashes, eye inflammation. The kidneys and liver may be affected. In many cases, recovery is slow-the nervous system could be
affected, producing symptoms similar to meningitis. Seek urgent medical attention.

## **Bites/stings**

Many species of animals and insects bite or sting. Cat and dog bites are fairly common—less so, are bites and stings from smaller creatures
such as hornets, scorpions and jellyfish. It may not always be clear what has caused a sudden pain, especially if a sting occurs while swimming.
If in any doubt, seek medical attention.

Some people may have extreme allergic reactions to bites and stings ([see Anaphylactic shock](#anaphylactic-shock)). In rare cases,
this can be life-threatening. Unfortunately a person has no way of knowing whether they are particularly sensitive until a problem develops.

### Animal bites

Always have an animal bite inspected and treated. There is a high risk of infection from bacteria or viruses in the animal’s saliva. Depending
on where you are in the world, this is particularly important if there is any possibility of rabies. Cat bites more commonly become infected than
dog bites—this is thought to be because the puncture wounds are smaller, preventing natural seepage of fluids. It may be advisable to report
any dog bite to the police. The animal might prove a danger to other people. ALWAYS seek medical attention.

### Human bites

Whatever the reason for the bite, it should be remembered that infection of the wound is very likely. Tetanus booster shots may be advisable.
Certain viruses may be transmitted in the saliva of infected people, including hepatitis, rabies, herpes—HIV transmission may even occur. A
human bite must ALWAYS receive medical attention.

### Bee/wasp/hornet sting

Get medical help immediately if anyone is stung more than once or stung in the mouth or throat. The latter is dangerous because the swelling
caused by the sting could obstruct breathing. If possible, give the victim ice cubes to suck.

TREATMENT Bee stings should be carefully removed by stroking the sting with the side of a needle and then extracting it with tweezers. Do not
squeeze or prod the poison sac, as this will only release more venom. Apply bicarbonate of soda in a cold compress.

WARNING: Some people are allergic to insect stings. Seek URGENT medical attention if anyone shows signs such as:

- Facial and throat swelling
- Wheezing/breathing difficulties
- Vomiting
- Dizziness
- Severe itchy rash
- Collapse

### Scorpion sting

May be no more serious than a bee sting. Some species may be particularly venomous and a sting could cause diarrhoea, vomiting, sweating and
severe pain. The heart may be affected. It is likely to be more serious for the elderly or young children. ALWAYS seek urgent medical attention.
It may be necessary to use an antivenin to control the effects of the sting.

### Spider bite

A tarantula bite is generally about as serious as a bee sting. Other species including the black widow and the brown recluse (US), the funnel web
and red-back (Australia) may occasionally cause death. If you have been bitten by any spider, seek urgent medical attention. It may be necessary
to use an antivenin—these are available for all dangerous species.

### Jellyfish stings

May range from a mild itchy rash to incapacitating pain. DON’T touch any fragments of ‘tentacle’ adhering to the skin—vinegar
(acetic) acid should be used to neutralize their stinging capability. Calamine lotion will soothe. Many dangerous species are found in tropical
waters. The effects of the Portuguese man-of-war (not strictly a jellyfish) may be severe. Stings are most dangerous while swimming far from
shore. The pain may make it difficult to move—let alone swim. After any sting, ALWAYS seek medical attention. If there is sweating,
vomiting, breathing difficulties, convulsions or loss of consciousness, SEEK URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION.

### Fish ‘stings’

Mainly in tropical waters, some species of fish such as scorpion fish and stone fish may be extremely venomous. The blue-ringed octopus, sea
urchins and stingrays can cause severe injury, too. Even if you have not identified what type of creature has caused the pain (by a bite or
poisonous sting) SEEK URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION.

### Snake bite

Victim may feel dizzy, nauseous, hot and faint. Effects vary according to species of snake, its size, the amount of venom injected and the age,
health and size of the victim. SEEK URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION. With prompt treatment, most victims recover fully. Antivenin, antibiotic drugs and
tetanus injections should be given in the event of any bite, poisonous or otherwise. If you kill the snake, keep the body to aid identification so
that the antivenin can be matched accurately. NEVER apply a tourniquet.

REMEMBER: The chances of serious injury or death as a result of being bitten by a snake are slight. Nevertheless, you should avoid all possible
confrontations with snakes. Never corner a snake. Never try to pick one up with a stick. Never approach one to take a photograph—the snake
could interpret your behaviour as a threat. Given the enormous variety of poisonous snakes and the enormous variety of potential victims (in terms
of age, sensitivity, health), the results of a bite can be highly unpredictable. Never hurry a snake-bite victim—it will speed the passage
of poison around the body.

## **Substance abuse**

:::tip[PLEASE NOTE]

Substance ‘abuse’ is a very misleading term. It should refer to the abuse of one’s body with a substance—after all, it’s
not the substance that’s being abused. More correctly, we should say substance ‘use’ or ‘misuse’.

:::

<!--p></p-->

Heavy drinking, tobacco smoking, taking certain ‘drugs’ for non-medicinal purposes or inhaling solvents, are all types of substance use or
misuse. They are all very dangerous and can lead to death in many ways-through poisoning, accident, disease, choking, anaphylactic shock (severe
allergic reaction) or heart failure. Intravenous drug users, who share needles, are at increased risk of contracting HIV and hepatitis B.

The only way to reduce the health risks of tobacco smoking is to STOP SMOKING. Habitual alcohol and drug users must also try to stop but, like
smokers, may need medical and emotional support. Confidential self-help groups like Alcoholics/ Narcotics Anonymous, worldwide organizations,
offer practical help and companionship for those who wish to break flee.

The use of ‘drugs’, the misuse of prescribed drugs and the misuse of other substances to relax or to achieve out-of-the-ordinary or
‘mystical’ experiences are widely publicized. In most countries, governments provide leaflets in health centres, schools and colleges
drawing attention to the risks. Many young people ‘experiment’. Some are more vulnerable to peer pressure. Most will lose interest after a
short time, with no lasting ill effects. This is NOT a new phenomenon (remember ‘reefers’ in the 1950s?). Parents should look back to
their own teenage years—the first cigarette (and how disgusting it tasted!) and the first under-age alcoholic drink.

Many anti-drug campaigns are aimed directly at heroin, cocaine and crack. The popular belief that cannabis use can inevitably lead to use of these
drugs has been largely discounted. However, the use or misuse of certain drugs/ substances may cause distress to the user’s family and
friends—it may alter behaviour patterns, increase the risk of accident and may cause general ill health or actual physical harm. The
‘market’ is sometimes flooded with impure or contaminated products, which could kill—especially if injected. There is a danger with
mixing drugs/substances, or mixing drugs/substances with alcohol. The biggest risk is that of overdose, especially with sedative drugs.

Sedative drugs induce sleep and reduce muscle activity. If they are taken to excess, the whole body system is slowed down and this could result in
coma. Breathing may stop, the tongue may fall back and block the windpipe, or the unconscious user may choke on his/her own vomit. The user can
die.

The drugs/substances that most often result in coma are heroin, morphine, strong tranquillizers, barbiturates, glues, inhaled solvents, gases and
lighter fuels, and ALCOHOL. Coma is less likely to result from hallucinogens such as LSD, ‘magic’ mushrooms, cannabis or mild
tranquillizers.

Injecting a drug directly into a vein is the most dangerous way to take it, as the whole dose acts immediately and the ‘hit’ is more
intense. Blood may be ‘backwashed’ and stored in the syringe, which is why intravenous drug users who share needles are particularly at
risk from HIV and hepatitis B.

The body usually develops a tolerance for increasingly large doses of any drug/substance. Just as a drinker quickly finds that he/she has to drink
more to feel the effects of alcohol, so a drug/substance user has to take more to get a ‘hit’. If the user of a powerful drug, such as
heroin, decides to cut down, the tolerance gradually reduces. A single injection of the former high dose can then cause death.

### Overdose symptoms

Depending on the amount and type of drug/ substance involved, one or more of the following symptoms may occur:

- Vomiting
- Difficulty breathing
- Sweating
- Hallucination
- Dilation or contraction of the pupils
- Unconsciousness
- Coma

ACTION: This is a general guide for all types of drug/substance overdose:

- Seek urgent medical attention/CALL AN AMBULANCE if the victim is unconscious or having breathing difficulty. This is a life-threatening
    situation.
- Collect a sample of vomit and any evidence-syringe, pill, bottle or container-near the victim, which may help with medical diagnosis.
- If the victim is unconscious but breathing, check for any obstructions in the mouth and throat and place in the
    [recovery position](#recovery-position)([see Save a life!](#save-a-life)).
- If the victim stops breathing, you must begin artificial respiration immediately ([see Save a life!](#save-a-life)).
- Monitor the pulse. If the victim’s heart: stops beating (and ONLY if it does) apply
    [cardiac compression](#cardiac-compression)([see Save a life!](#save-a-life)).
- Stay with the victim and keep him/her calm. Make sure no more drugs/substances or alcohol are taken. Keep the victim away from bright lights
    and loud noise which may intensify the problem. Prevent any accidents. A ‘violent’ person may have to be physically restrained to
    prevent self-injury. Be as gentle as possible.
- If solvents/gases have been used, remove the source and open doors and windows. Take care to avoid the risk of fire, especially if flammable
    substances have been used.
- With milder drugs such as amyl nitrate and cannabis, it may only be necessary to wait for the effects to wear off provided that no other drugs
    have been used as well.
- NEVER induce vomiting, unless the victim has DEFINITELY taken tranquillizers or barbiturates very recently. The only safe way to do so, is to
    insert your fingers GENTLY into the mouth towards the throat until the victim’s ‘vomit reflex’ takes over. NEVER do this with the
    victim on his/her back. If the victim is semi-conscious or unconscious, there is a severe risk of choking, or of fluid entering the lungs.
    Always call an ambulance FIRST-don’t waste time!
- NEVER try to keep the victim awake by walking him/her around or by giving black coffee to drink. This will only speed the effects of the drug.

### Amphetamines

Swallowed in tablet or capsule form. Amphetamine sulphate powder is sniffed, swallowed, dissolved or injected. Traditionally known as
‘pep’ pills or ‘speed’.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: The user will be restless and irrational, with outbursts of delusions and hysterical behaviour, even fits. There will be rapid
breathing/pulse rate, twitching and increased body temperature.

### Amyl nitrate

Originally available only as glass ampoules containing a clear liquid. The vapours are inhaled. It is more common as ‘poppers’ in small,
usually brown, glass bottles. Smells like dry-cleaning fluid.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: Excessive doses will cause a severe headache and flushed skin, staggering and incoherence. The victim may collapse and have
difficulty breathing.

### Barbiturates

Capsules and tablets of barbiturates are swallowed, often with alcohol, which can prove fatal. Pentothal, though not common, is injected.
Barbiturates are ‘downers’.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: The victim may be drowsy, semiconscious or comatose. If Pentothal is injected breathing may stop, especially after a large dose.

### Cocaine

A fine white powder that may be sniffed (‘snorting’), dissolved in water and injected (‘mainlining’), mixed with tobacco and
smoked (‘freebasing’) or chewed in the form of coca leaves. Most available cocaine can be presumed to be impure. It is often combined with
amphetamine sulphate (‘speed’), which is cheaper. Particularly unscrupulous ‘dealers’ may extend the drug with almost ANY white
powder, sometimes with disastrous consequences.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: Cocaine overdose causes hysteria, delusions, physical tremors and fits. There may be an increase in the pulse, body temperature
and breathing rate. The user could suddenly collapse from anaphylactic shock.

### Cannabis

Smoked in ‘joints’ or pipes, on its own or mixed with tobacco. It may also be added to cake mixtures and eaten. The effects of the drug
are rarely dangerous. When taken to great excess, may impair judgement for several days. The main risk is that the drug may be contaminated with
poisonous plant matter or insecticides.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: Drowsiness, disorientation and mild hallucinations. In many cases, the user will fall asleep before toxic levels are reached.

### Solvents/gases

Freely available in the form of lighter fuel, glues, dry-cleaning agents, petrol, nail varnishes and removers, all of which give off an
intoxicating vapour. Glue or liquid is poured into a paper bag or onto a cloth and inhaled. The gases halon (used in some fire extinguishers) and
butane (used for lighter fuel) are also abused.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: Solvents/gases often lead to coma. Breathing may stop, particularly if the victim falls forward into the bag or cloth and
continues to inhale the fumes. Extreme exertion after prolonged use may put the heart at risk. Halon affects the nervous system and leads to
convulsions and even death.

### Heroin/morphine

Both are usually smoked, but can also be swallowed or injected directly into a vein (‘mainlining’) once dissolved in water. Both are
highly addictive.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: Vomiting, coma and contracted pupils. Breathing may stop.

### Methadone

A synthetic drug resembling morphine. In liquid or tablet form, it is usually swallowed. Otherwise, methadone may be injected into a vein. Widely
used in drug clinics to reduce the heavy dependence and cravings felt by heroin or morphine addicts. Methadone is not, however, without side
effects.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: The same as for heroin/morphine.

### Opium

Raw opium is smoked in a pipe or swallowed. Refined opium is swallowed, smoked, injected, or heated and the fumes inhaled.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: Similar to heroin/ morphine, but with less likelihood of breathing difficulties or coma.

### LSD

Most hallucinogens, including LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and magic mushrooms, are swallowed. LSD is also known as ‘acid’.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: Overdoses are rare, but accidents may occur through a ‘bad trip’ where the user experiences illusory terrors and tries
to escape them. Occasionally the user may become violent, especially if very frightened.

### Tranquillizers

Some tranquillizers, like Librium and Valium, are mild, whereas others like Largactil may have a profound sedative effect and can induce
drowsiness even in normal doses. They are swallowed or occasionally injected.

OVERDOSE SYMPTOMS: Dangerous if taken with alcohol-can result in coma. Coma is less likely if tranquillizers are used on their own. Most
tranquillizers used for prolonged periods (six weeks or more) are addictive or may lead to dependence. Even when prescribed by a doctor, they
should only be used for short periods.

## **Alcohol dependence**

Habitual and compulsive heavy drinking commonly leads to hypertension, heart disease, liver disorders and brain disorders. Alcohol over-use is
also closely linked to numerous social problems—traffic/industrial accidents, physical assault, marital breakdown, domestic violence and
child abuse. Alcohol IS a poison—if the drinker collapses or becomes unconscious, there is a possibility of alcohol poisoning.

SYMPTOMS: Heavy drinking. In more serious cases, nausea, vomiting, shaking in the morning, lapses of memory, abdominal pain, facial redness,
unsteadiness, confusion and irregular pulse. A habitual drinker may hide boules, become aggressive or grandiose, be drunk for long periods of
time, neglect his/ her appearance or food intake, constantly promise to give up and have uncontrollable personality changes such as anger,
violence and selfishness. After a heavy drinking session, the sufferer may be in a stupefied state. There is a severe danger that the drinker may
fall into a coma and stop breathing.

WARNING: Never assume that a person who looks drunk IS drunk. Other conditions such as diabetes mellitus and some drugs can produce similar
apparent effects. Always check for the smell of alcohol.

ACTION: In the event of collapse or unconsciousness, seek urgent medical attention. If breathing stops while you are waiting, give artificial
respiration. Do NOT induce vomiting. Loosen tight clothing, check that the mouth is clear. Place casualty in the
[recovery position](#recovery-position) to keep air-way open ([see Save a life!](#save-a-life)).

REMEMBER: Treatment to help compulsive drinkers give up drinking altogether involves detoxification to help them get over withdrawal symptoms,
which may include—in extreme cases—hallucinations (delirium tremens), severe shaking and convulsions. Longterm counselling and support
may be needed to help them rebuild their lives. People who think they have an alcohol problem should contact their doctor or a help group such as
Alcoholics Anonymous as soon as possible.

### Tobacco smoking

Nicotine, a constituent of tobacco, contains several cancer-causing (carcinogenic) substances. There is a direct link between the amount smoked
and the likelihood of cancer of the lung, mouth, lips, throat, kidney, pancreas and bladder. The majority of people with head and neck cancers
have a history of heavy alcohol use and smoking.

Another harmful effect of smoking is coronary heart disease, which kills more middle-aged men in industrial societies than any other disease.
Smokers are about three times more likely to contract the disease than non-smokers. Smoking also damages the arteries of the legs and brain and
can lead to strokes. A number of other diseases have been linked with tobacco smoking.

WARNING: Smoking and pregnancy: Smoking is extremely harmful during pregnancy—the foetus is likely to be smaller with less chance of
survival. After birth, children of smokers are more likely to develop asthma and other respiratory diseases.

A woman who smokes during pregnancy increases her child’s risk of getting cancer. Other risks include spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and
premature birth, as well as a baby of impaired growth and increased susceptibility to infection.

PASSIVE SMOKING People who live, work or spend a lot of time in the company of smokers are at risk of contracting smoking-related illnesses.
Passive smokers often suffer the immediate discomforts of coughing, wheezing and watery eyes. Evidence shows that the children of smokers take in
the equivalent of 80 cigarettes each year and are more likely to smoke when they are older. It is also thought that those who live with smokers
have an increased risk of developing lung cancer.

STOPPING SMOKING If you want to stop smoking, the first and most important thing to do is to decide that you definitely will give up. Cutting down
is usually only temporary. Acupuncture, hypnosis and chewing gum containing nicotine may help. Many people do not like the idea of gaining weight
if they stop smoking. This is NOT a foregone conclusion, although it may occur temporarily because smoking increases the metabolic rate (the rate
at which the body uses up food). Those who give up tend to eat more at first—sweets and ‘comfort’ foods may satisfy
‘cravings’. However, it is far safer to be slightly overweight than to smoke. Smoking is an addiction and a smoker wishing to give up may
need help and support from family, friends, or a help group.

### Coffee & tea

Some people may be surprised to find these common beverages classed as dangerous substances. But both contain tannin and caffeine, which have
adverse effects on the body. Both can become addictive.

Coffee contains caffeine in larger amounts than tea or cola drinks. Caffeine is a stimulant drug, which affects all the organs and tissues of the
body. In the short term, caffeine combats drowsiness and fatigue and can help the drinker to concentrate. In larger quantities (more than five
cups per day)it may cause overstimulation, anxiety, irritability and restlessness. If you are suffering from or being treated for any
anxiety-related condition, the effects may be dangerous.

Research shows that people who drink coffee throughout the week (at work, perhaps) often suffer withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability,
headaches and fatigue, at the weekends if they go without a cup of coffee for just a few hours. Caffeine overdose causes muscle twitching, heart
palpitations and abdominal pain.

As with other drugs, users tend to build up a level of tolerance and have to drink more before they are able to feel the effects. Caffeine can
improve short-term athletic performance and is therefore banned in high doses during sports competitions.

Tea also contains caffeine, but in smaller doses than in coffee. More importantly, it contains tannin which was once used for medicinal purposes
but has now been found to cause liver damage and constipation in large doses. Tannin is also suspected of having links with mouth cancer.

Oil of bergamot, used in Earl Grey tea, contains agents that are suspected of being cancer-forming (though this is unproven). Even herbal teas,
which can contain impurities, may have side effects. Some people may develop an allergy to camomile tea. Comfrey tea has been reported to cause
liver toxicity and even liver damage.

Any kind of tea is best taken in moderation. It is wise not to drink the same variety of scented tea over long periods of time.

## **Emergencies**

<!--p></p-->

There are numerous health emergencies that can occur or develop which might be hard to recognize. Some are much more common than others, but ALL
of the following may be life-threatening.

### Anaphylactic shock

Uncommon dangerous allergic reaction to a substance-penicillin, antitetanus, local anaesthetic, poison, drug, a particular food, an insect
sting/bite, a snake bite. Look for the possible cause.

SYMPTOMS: Pain in abdomen, swelling of the face, tongue or throat, diarrhoea, constriction of the airways to the lungs, itchy rash and a sudden
lowering of blood pressure.

ACTION: Lay the victim down and raise his/ her legs to ease the flow of blood to the heart and brain. If unconscious, place in
[recovery position](#recovery-position). If breathing or heartbeat cease, give artificial respiration and/or
[cardiac compression](#cardiac-compression)([see Save a life!](#save-a-life)). In most cases, an injection of Adrenalin is
required. Seek URGENT medical attention.

REMEMBER: ALWAYS carry a card which describes your particular allergy. People who are known to have a severe allergy which could lead to
anaphylactic shock are encouraged to carry a syringe of Adrenalin at all times. If you know such a person, familiarize yourself with the procedure
in case help is needed at any time.

### Appendicitis

Acute and painful inflamation of the appendix. The cause is usually unknown, but may be due to an obstruction of the appendix by faeces. Without
surgery, the appendix may become further inflamed and infected, which may cause gangrene (tissue death)in the appendix wall. The appendix may
burst. Appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal surgery in developed countries. However, it is rare in the very young or the elderly.

SYMPTOMS: Discomfort in the central abdominal area. This commonly develops into a more intense pain in the lower right-hand side. It is usually
accompanied by loss of appetite, vomiting, nausea, coated tongue and unpleasant breath.

ACTION: Seek URGENT medical attention.

### Gallstones

Stones that develop in the gall bladder when a chemical imbalance occurs in the composition of bile.

SYMPTOMS: Most cases of gallstones do not have any symptoms, unless a stone becomes lodged and blocks the duct leading from the gall bladder. This
can cause severe pain in the upper abdomen or between the shoulder blades, nausea and vomiting, flatulence, even jaundice.

ACTION: Seek medical attention, urgently if there is great pain or distress.

RISK GROUPS Gallstones are unlikely to occur until after puberty. More women are affected than men—particularly if they have had several
children. Being overweight adds to the risk.

### Hepatitis A, B & C

Inflammation of the liver, which is usually caused by viral infection. Hepatitis C (also known as non-AJnon-B hepatitis)is caused by more than one
virus.

Hepatitis A is transmitted by food and water that has been contaminated by faeces. Most of the world’s population has been infected by the
virus at some point in life and a natural immunity has been established. Only those people with no immunity are at risk from the virus.

Hepatitis B is commonly transmitted sexually or by contaminated blood. Intravenous drug users are particularly at risk. Carriers may have no
apparent symptoms and infect others unknowingly. A vaccine is available, but is only recommended for highrisk groups—people with many sexual
partners, prostitutes and their clients, intravenous drug users, doctors and nurses. Preventative measures include practising safe sex, not
sharing needles, and making sure that equipment for tattooing and ear or other piercing is properly sterilized.

Now that blood to be transfused is made safe by heat treatment, there is no danger of Hepatitis B or C being caused by blood transfusion in most
countries. Transfusions and surgical procedures/equipment in underdeveloped countries, however, carry a greater risk to the patient.

SYMPTOMS: Slight to very severe flu-like symptoms, which do not pass. Weakness, lethargy, nausea (especially at the thought of food). Urine may be
dark, while faeces may be pale. Jaundice tends to develop later.

ACTION: If a form of hepatitis is suspected, seek urgent medical attention. There is no direct treatment for types of viral hepatitis, but plenty
of bed rest, a balanced diet and avoidance of alcohol all help.

### Kidney failure

Occurs when one or both kidneys become partially or totally unable to filter the blood (normally waste products are passed into the urine).
Kidneys also help control blood pressure and salt levels. The condition may occur suddenly (acute) or over a period of time (chronic).

SYMPTOMS: Acute kidney failure is characterized by a reduced need to pass urine, lassitude, vomiting and shortness of breath. It may occur after
serious illness, severe injury or physical shock, such as heart attack, heavy bleeding or burns.

Chronic kidney failure usually begins with nausea, loss of appetite and weakness. It may be a result of diseases that affect the kidneys such as
diabetes mellitus. Diabetics should be aware of this risk. If the condition is not treated immediately it will lead to fatigue, vomiting, weight
loss, headaches, bad breath, itchy skin and to collapse, coma and even death.

WARNING: Acute kidney failure can be cured if treated without delay. If it is allowed to develop, chronic kidney failure cannot be cured. Seek
urgent medical attention.

### Liver failure

May be as a complication of acute/chronic hepatitis, but also associated with cirrhosis of the liver, which may be caused by alcoholism.

SYMPTOMS: Weakness and loss of appetite, vomiting, aching muscles, restlessness, fatigue and possibly coma. Jaundice may develop. The brain may be
affected.

ACTION: Seek urgent medical attention.

### Meningitis

Inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord usually caused by a bacterium or virus. A vaccination is available, but so for
it is of only limited use. Bacterial meningitis is the more dangerous. Most cases are young children.

SYMPTOMS: Unremitting headache, fever, vomiting, and a need to keep away from light. Babies may have high-pitched cry, blotchy skin, fretfulness
and difficulty with waking and feeding. Viral meningitis (fairly common in winter) is less serious and has influenza-like symptoms.

ACTION: Seek URGENT medical attention. Viral meningitis usually requires no actual treatment. The worst symptoms usually clear in a week or two,
but some headache and lassitude can persist for as long as three months. Bacterial meningitis needs immediate treatment, usually with intravenous
antibiotics. There is a slight risk of some damage being caused to the brain and the condition can be life-threatening.

### Peptic ulcers

These affect one in eight people at some time in their lives and may occur in the duodenum, stomach or oesophagus.

SYMPTOMS: May include a burning pain in the abdomen which is relieved by eating but returns after a few hours. A common complication is bleeding
from the ulcer, which may result in blood being vomited and the production of black faeces. Such bleeding may cause anaemia and is
life-threatening.

ACTION: If you think you may have a peptic ulcer, seek medical attention. Antacid medication will neutralize the excess acidity and help the ulcers
to heal. Drugs to treat peptic ulcers are now commonly available.

REMEMBER: Some ulcers respond to self-help. Stop smoking, avoid alcohol, tea, coffee and aspirin, eat several small meals a day rather than two or
three large ones. As psychological stress is a factor, investigate the causes of stress in your life, and look into relaxation techniques.

### Ruptures/hernias

Ruptures/hernias are caused by an organ or other tissues pushing through a weak area of muscle. Usually abdominal, they have been known to occur
where incisions have been made for an operation.

Groin ruptures are common. In men, these appear as a bulge in the groin or scrotum; in women, as a swelling at the top of the thigh. Sometimes the
bulge can be pushed back, but when this is impossible, there may be great pain.

Ruptures and hernias are often caused by lifting heavy objects-especially in older people with weaker muscles, people who are overweight and
people with a congenital abdominal weakness. Other causes are persistent coughing, straining to pass faeces and sporting injuries.

WARNING: ‘Strangled’ hernia: A rupture which is accompanied by vomiting may indicate that the swelling has cut off the blood supply. Lay
the victim in a half-sitting position with head and shoulders supported. Do not attempt to reduce swelling. Seek urgent medical attention. Surgery
may be necessary.

### Septicaemia

Serious, possibly life-threatening condition-otherwise known as blood poisoning. Caused by the multiplication of bacteria and the subsequent
release of toxins. Septicaemia can result from an existing infection or an infected burn or wound. In some cases, septic shock may occur. This
involves tissue damage and a dramatic drop in blood pressure, which interferes with the circulatory system and can damage the kidneys, heart and
lungs.

SYMPTOMS: Shivering, fever, ‘panting’, headache and (usually) confusion or delirium. Hands may be hot. There may be rashes or jaundice. In
septic shock, a feeble rapid pulse signals an emergency.

ACTION: Antibiotic drugs and intensive treatment mean that the likelihood of death through septicaemia has been greatly reduced. The survival rate
for septic shock, however, is still as low as 50 per cent. Seek URGENT medical attention.

### Tetanus

Disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. Infection can occur through cuts and
wounds. Tetanus vaccination is given as a matter of course to all children, in the UK at least. Booster vaccines are recommended every ten years.
NEVER neglect any wound or animal bite, particularly if it is deep. Bathe wound immediately. ALWAYS seek medical attention.

SYMPTOMS: Contraction of the facial muscles resulting in a fixed grimace, stiffness at the hinges of the jaw (lockjaw) and aches in the back and
abdomen. There may also be fever and heavy sweating. If untreated, there may be painful spasms in the muscles. Rarely, these lead to suffocation.

ACTION: Tetanus can be fatal, but the majority of people who are treated sufficiently early make a complete recovery. Seek URGENT medical
attention.

## **Save a life!**

In an urban situation medical help is never very far away. A phone call will bring an ambulance. Untrained people should NOT attempt to give
treatment that goes beyond first aid—which aims to sustain life and prevent the situation deteriorating before medical help arrives.

There are many cases where prompt action can prevent worsening of an injury, ease discomfort and sometimes even save a life. In cases of cardiac
arrest, or when breathing has stopped or when it is impaired, first aid can be of vital importance, if administered properly while waiting for an
ambulance to arrive.

EVERYONE should have a knowledge of basic first-aid procedures so that they are equipped to deal with any emergency. Take a course and learn how
to do it properly. No book can compete with qualified people in terms of demonstrating the correct techniques and procedures.

The techniques given here should enable you to provide urgent help in emergencies in the city.

:::danger[BE AN EXPERT!]

Do YOU know how to apply first aid-even just the basics? WHY NOT? It is absolutely ESSENTIAL that one person in every home and one person in
every department of every workplace knows how to deal with medical emergencies. Don’t be the parent or the friend who watches helplessly
while a loved one dies.

:::

### Further danger?

Once the immediate threat to life has been dealt with and emergency medical assistance is on its way, it is YOUR responsibility to reduce any
further threat/danger to the victim or yourself. Under most circumstances you should try NOT to move or carry the victim-you may cause further
injury to the victim and to yourself.

It may be essential to move him/her away from a source of danger—a fire or a collapsing building. In the case of a road accident, stop the
traffic—if the victim is inside a vehicle, ONLY move them if there is the threat of further injury from fire or explosion.

### Post-traumatic stress

After any accident, attack, injury or extremely stressful event in a person’s life, there may be a period of anxiety, fear or depression. It
may begin immediately, or over a period of months—often as the person ‘relives’ the event in their mind. YOU can lessen the trauma
at the onset—reducing the embarrassment, fear and panic of a casualty during the event by giving as much caring reassurance as possible.
Hold a hand. Stroke a forehead.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

DON’T PANIC

Panic affects judgement and coordination. Stay calm, you may need to give the casualty constant reassurance. Knowledge of first aid is itself
an antidote to panic.

IMPROVISE

You can’t prepare for every emergency and each requires a different response. Be ready to use a T-shirt to control heavy bleeding or an
ordinary credit card to close a sucking wound over a punctured lung until medical help arrives.

ASSESS RISKS

Consider the dangers of each possible course of action. Choose the one you believe to be the best.

If there are other people who can help, send someone to call an ambulance while you give the casualty urgent aid. Tell them what to say so
that the emergency service know what to expect when they arrive and will have things ready to help the casualty’s needs. If there are more
people than are needed to help, send them away. Crowding round can increase the casualty’s distress and obstruct emergency services when
they arrive. If you witness an accident and see the injured are already being well-cared for, move on. Don’t get in the way.

If you suspect that the casualty may have a disease and that there is a risk of infection, protect yourself by wearing gloves or putting your
hands into plastic bags. The AIDS crisis has made people very frightened of coming into contact with other people’s blood. If someone is
bleeding severely, you MUST do something!

:::

:::danger[Warning]

NEVER induce vomiting, unless you are absolutely certain that the casualty has swallowed barbiturates/tranquillizers/poisonous plant material
very recently.

NEVER use tourniquets.

NEVER remove large pieces of glass or metal from a wound.

NEVER give up. Always do all you can to help and wait for medical help before assuming that someone is dead-drowning victims can sometimes be
resuscitated for 25 minutes after being presumed dead.

:::

Do everything you can to keep ‘onlookers’ away. You may need help to care for a casualty and you WILL need someone to call an ambulance.
DON’T permit people to crowd round a casualty, particularly if they are saying things like: ‘Is he dying?’, ‘Isn’t she
bleeding a lot!’ and, appallingly thoughtless as it may seem, ‘Look, her foot’s come off’.

Often called ‘shock’, this post-traumatic stress may need to be treated by support and counselling as part of general aftercare.

### First-aid kit

Normally a small first-aid kit is intended for minor accidents, but equip yours to be able to apply first aid to more serious injuries. Keep it in
a sealed plastic container, out of reach of children and in a cool dry place. Your kit should contain:

- Antiseptic lotion and antiseptic wipes
- Cotton wool for cleaning wounds—NEVER use cotton wool or any ‘fluffy’ fabric as a dressing. Even a clean T-shirt or a pad of
    clean lavatory paper would do in an emergency
- Blunt-ended scissors for cutting bandages/dressings
- Painkillers such as aspirin/paracetamol—NEVER exceed the stated dosage
- Antihistamine cream for insect stings/bites
- Thermometers (oral and rectal)
- Tweezers to remove large splinters
- Eyebath/eyewash solution
- Adhesive dressings for small cuts and grazes
- Roll of fabric adhesive tape
- Triangular bandage and safety pins for making slings
- Sterile dressing for covering wounds
- Sterile eye dressing and bandages for eye injuries
- Crepe bandages for sprains and wounds in awkward places such as elbows/knees/ankles
- Tubular gauze bandages and applicator tongs for whole-finger dressings

## **First aid**

You are in an emergency first-aid situation, an ambulance has been called and it’s on its way, but do you know what to do next and
shouldn’t you be doing it already? The concept of saving a person’s life may seem daunting but, in fact, life can often be sustained by a
few simple procedures.

The instructions given in this chapter may seem complex, but to save a life all a casualty needs is an unobstructed airway with adequate breathing
AND blood circulation. It’s that simple. Knowing this helps to work out when a first-aid situation is life-threatening.

You must act at once if a casualty has stopped breathing, their heart has stopped beating or if they are bleeding severely. If they are
unconscious, the airway may become blocked and they may suffocate. In any more serious first-aid situation, your first priority is to check the
casualty’s vital functions:

### Open airway

A blocked or obstructed airway can be caused by a foreign body—such as food or vomit—or by a constriction of the air
passage—often as a result of unconsciousness and by the tongue itself (which can fall back inside the mouth). To check, with the casualty on
their back:

Lift up casualty’s jaw to dislodge tongue, tilting the head back. If breathing is heavy or noisy, check if there is any blockage in the mouth.
Sweep a finger around inside, but DON’T push any matter back into the throat. Place casualty in
[RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position)

### Check breathing

If casualty is unconscious, detecting breathing can be difficult—use your eyes, ears and touch. Hold victim’s airway open as in OPEN
AIRWAY and place your ear over mouth and nose. Look at line of victim’s chest for any movement, while listening. Feel for breath on your
cheek.

### Pulse

The heart pumps blood around the body, so it is VITAL to know whether this function is still being carried out. Putting your ear to the chest and
listening will not always work—feeling for blood flow in arteries just below the skin, a pulse, will. To check:

The most reliable pulse can be felt at the neck—the carotid pulse. Turn face to one side. Slide fingers from voice box into depression
alongside and press gently.

With a baby check brachial pulse, located on inside of upper arm midway between shoulder and elbow. Press index and middle fingertips lightly
towards bone.

### Check bleeding

Major external bleeding will be obvious, but a dramatic loss in body fluid (including blood) may not be apparent if the injury is internal. Check
for:

- Pale/grey skin, particularly in and around lips
- Cold skin
- Shallow/rapid breathing
- Weak/rapid pulse
- If victim is unconscious, clear airway and treat for [SEVERE BLEEDING/SHOCK](#severe-bleeding)

:::tip[INTO ACTION!]

If a check tells you that a vital body function is impaired, act IMMEDIATELY. If you are alone, stabilize the casualty before leaving to find
a telephone. If you have help, send someone to phone for an ambulance while you attend to the casualty.

:::

## **Breathing**

If a casualty has stopped breathing, oxygen cannot enter the body and they will die in minutes—irreversible brain damage can occur after
four minutes. If the airway is clear, but there is no breathing, begin artificial respiration. The best method is
[mouth-to-mouth](#mouth-to-mouth), although mouth-to-nose and mouth-to-mouth-and-nose are also used.

### Mouth-to-mouth

Also known as the kiss of life, the aim is to get air into the lungs. Position the head to OPEN AIRWAY. Check for blockages in the mouth/throat.
Remove loose dentures (leave fixed ones). Loosen restrictive clothing around casualty’s throat and chest.

Make sure the head and chin are tilted well back. Hold the nostrils closed with a finger and thumb.

Seal your mouth over casualty’s mouth and blow two quick breaths (inflations), watching the chest. It should rise. Remove your mouth and chest
will fall. If chest does NOT rise, the airway may still be blocked. Check airway is open. You may need to treat casualty for
[CHOKING](#choking-unconscious)

Check [PULSE](#pulse). If there is no pulse, use [CARDIAC COMPRESSION](#cardiac-compression) Continue
[mouth-to-mouth](#mouth-to-mouth) at a rate of 12-16 inflations a minute until breathing is restored. DON’T GIVE UP. You may need
to assist the casualty’s breathing with further inflations. When the casualty is breathing independently, place in
[RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position)

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If it is not possible to use casualty’s mouth for artificial respiration, use nostrils instead. Seal casualty’s mouth with thumb and
put your mouth over nostrils. Proceed with artificial respiration. This method is useful if the mouth is injured or in cases of suspected
poisoning, where you may be at risk of contamination.

:::

:::info[BABY/CHILD]

Infants need special techniques for artificial respiration:

- Seal your mouth round baby’s/child’s mouth AND nostrils. Don’t tilt a baby’s head back too far.
- Breathe gently into lungs at a rate of 20 inflations a minute.
- Check pulse after two inflations - [see PULSE](#pulse).

:::

## **Circulation**

Your [PULSE](#pulse) check will tell you if the casualty’s heart is beating. If it has stopped, there is no point in continuing
with only artificial respiration because blood circulation is necessary to take oxygen to the brain. The heart must be squeezed between breastbone
and spine, effectively operating it like a hand pump. [cardiac compression](#cardiac-compression) must be applied in conjunction with
[mouth-to-mouth](#mouth-to-mouth).

:::danger[Warning]

Compression should ONLY be carried out by someone who is trained in first aid, who has had practice in the technique and who can establish
conclusively whether or not the casualty’s heart has stopped. NEVER give compression if the heart IS beating-even if only a very faint
pulse can be felt. You could stop the heart.

:::

### Cardiac compression

Lay the casualty on their back on a firm surface and kneel at their side. Place heel of one hand on lower half of casualty’s breastbone
(sternum)—the central chest bone between the ribs. Make sure your hand is about an inch above where the ribs meet, NOT on the end of the
breastbone or below it. Place the heel of the other hand on top. Keep fingers off casualty’s chest.

With arms straight, rock forward and press down about 4cm (1&frac12;in) 15 times. The rate should be at about 80 times per minute-that’s more
than once per second. Press smoothly and firmly. Erratic or rough pressure could cause injury.

Give two lung inflations, [mouth-to-mouth](#mouth-to-mouth), and continue the sequence—15 compressions, two inflations. Make the
first check for victim’s pulse after one minute, thereafter at three-minute intervals. DON’T GIVE UP.

If two first aiders are present, give five compressions followed by one deep inflation on the upstroke of the fifth compression. Repeat. First
aider giving [mouth-to-mouth](#mouth-to-mouth) should also check pulse. DON’T GIVE UP.

As soon as a pulse is detected, STOP compressions, but continue [mouth-to-mouth](#mouth-to-mouth) until casualty is breathing unaided.
Place victim in [RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position)

:::info[BABY/CHILD]

Use less pressure and more compressions. For a baby/toddler, light pressure with two fingers is enough, at a rate of 100 compressions per
minute. Only depress the chest about 2.5cm (1in). For older children up to ten years, use the heel of one hand only and push lightly 90-100
times per minute to a depth of about 3.5cm (1 3/8in). Give five compressions to one lung inflation.

:::

## **Choking: unconscious**

Breathing has stopped, but artificial respiration fails to raise casualty’s chest. The airway is blocked. You MUST remove the obstruction.
First clear casualty’s mouth by turning head to one side and sweeping the inside of the mouth with two fingers. DON’T push any object
further down the throat! Take particular care when doing this to a baby. If this fails, use:

### Back slaps

Roll UNCONSCIOUS casualty onto side and support chest with your thigh. Position casualty’s head well back to open airway. Slap casualty
smartly between shoulder blades with heel of your hand. Repeat up to four times if necessary. Check the mouth to see if the blockage has been
dislodged.

### Abdominal thrust

If back slaps fail, try abdominal thrusts. The aim is to use the air in the casualty’s lungs to dislodge a blockage by a series of thrusts to
the upper abdomen. Such action could damage internal organs. Use the abdominal thrust ONLY as a last resort.

Place UNCONSCIOUS casualty on back with head in OPEN AIRWAY position. Kneel astride casualty’s thighs—if this is not possible, kneel
alongside.

Place your hands, one on top of the other, with the heels of your hands resting above navel. Keep fingers clear.

With your arms straight, make quick thrusts upwards and inwards as if up into the centre of the rib cage. Thrusts must be strong enough to
dislodge blockage. Repeat up to four times if necessary.

:::info[BABY/CHILD (UNCONSCIOUS)]

For a child, technique is the same as for adults—but use only one hand and don’t press quite so hard. For a baby, put two fingers of
one or both hands between the navel and bottom of breastbone. Press downwards/forwards quickly. Repeat up to four times, if necessary.

:::

### Choking: conscious

#### Symptoms

- Casualty may be panicking and clasping throat
- Casualty cannot speak or make any sound
- Veins of the face and neck may be ‘bulging’
- There may be blue discolouration of the lips
- Casualty obviously cannot breathe or
- Casualty may stand up and thrash about
- If there is any breathing, it may be very noisy

:::info[IS IT A HEART ATTACK?]

- Victim clutches chest, not throat
- Casualty (if able to speak) complains of chest pain
- Rapid breathing, usually quiet and shallow
- Casualty may sit down or slump

If you suspect a heart attack, CALL AN AMBULANCE. [See HEART ATTACK](#heart-attack)

:::

Encourage casualty to cough out the blockage. If they cannot, help them to a chair and bend their head over between their knees so that it is
lower than lungs. Slap them sharply between the shoulder blades, using the heel of your hand. Slap four times, if necessary. Check casualty’s
mouth to see if blockage is dislodged. Repeat slaps. If blockage is not dislodged, use ‘conscious’
[abdominal thrust—HEIMLICH MANOEUVRE](#heimlich-manoeuvre)

:::info[BABY/CHILD (CONSCIOUS)]

Lay a child over your lap with head hanging down, supporting child under chest. Use [back slaps](#back-slaps) with the heel of your
hand’. If blockage is not dislodged, use [HEIMLICH MANOEUVRE](#heimlich-manoeuvre)

For a baby/toddler, use a lot less pressure when slapping. Be prepared to use [ABDOMINAL THRUST](#abdominal-thrust) if blockage is
not dislodged. If you use your fingers to try to remove a blockage from the mouth or throat of a baby/ toddler, be VERY careful not to force
the blockage further in.

:::

### Heimlich manoeuvre

With a CONSCIOUS choking casualty, stand behind them and put your arms around them. Make a fist of one hand and press it thumb inwards above the
navel, but below the breastbone. Clasp your other hand round the first.

Pull upwards and inwards with a quick movement up to four times. Pressure used should compress the upper abdomen. If there is no response, repeat
[BACK SLAPS](#back-slaps) and return to [Heimlich manoeuvre](#heimlich-manoeuvre). Check the mouth to see if the blockage
has been dislodged.

:::info[BABY/CHILD (CONSCIOUS)]

For a baby, use [conventional ABDOMINAL THRUST](#abdominal-thrust). For a child, depending on height, stand or kneel behind them or
sit them on your lap. Support the back with one hand and apply the [Heimlich manoeuvre](#heimlich-manoeuvre) with one hand only.
Don’t use nearly as much pressure as for an adult, but the pressure must be sufficient to force out the blockage.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If you are alone, adapt the [Heimlich manoeuvre](#heimlich-manoeuvre) by positioning yourself to use the back of a chair, the post
at the bottom of a staircase or any other blunt projection.

:::

## **Severe bleeding**

An adult has around 6 litres (11 pints) of circulating blood. The loss of 0.5 litre (1 pint) can cause mild faintness. Loss of 1 litre (2 pints)
causes faintness, increased pulse rate and shallow breathing. 1.5 litres (3 pints) leads to collapse, and more than 2.25 litres (4 pints) can be
fatal. Immediate steps must be taken to stop blood loss.

Bleeding may not be apparent—internal bleeding may occur, particularly after a fall, a blow or a crushing injury. Severe external or
internal bleeding often leads to [SHOCK](#shock)— Shock can kill.

Blood releases its own first-aid agent when bleeding occurs. Particles in blood form clots which plug up the wound and stop the flow. If bleeding
is heavy, clotting cannot take place but you can help by restricting the flow of blood from a wound. If the wound is small restrict blood flow by:

### Direct pressure

Place your finger, hand or a dressing over the wound and press. This squeezes the blood vessels around the wound and cuts the blood supply.
Pressure MUST be kept up for at least five to 15 minutes to let clotting take effect.

Ideally you should cover the wound with a sterile dressing, but the priority is to prevent blood loss so use any clean nonfluffy cloth. DON’T
lift the dressing up to look underneath.

If no dressing is available, use your hand. Squeeze the edges of a gaping wound together. If the wound is on a limb, raise it above the level of
the heart—lay the victim down and prop up head or limbs.

If YOU are wounded and alone, use a free hand to apply direct pressure to a wound—do NOT wait for assistance.

:::danger[Warning]

If there is anything embedded in the wound-a piece of glass or metal, perhaps-do NOT attempt to remove it. Apply pressure beside the fragment.

:::

If there is more than one serious wound, pads/dressings to control bleeding may be fixed in place with bandages or improvised bandages—but
NOT tied so tightly that circulation is restricted.

:::tip[PRIORITIES]

When bleeding is coupled with cessation of breathing, treat both at the same time. This is a double emergency.

:::

### Pressure points

If there are multiple lacerations on a limb and a large amount of blood is being lost OR if there is major arterial bleeding (blood is bright red
and spurts rhythmically), you MUST act very quickly.

You must find the place where the relevant artery crosses a bone, and apply pressure with your fingers to slow or cut off the flow of blood.

:::danger[Warning]

Do NOT apply pressure at a pressure point for more than 15 minutes. You are cutting off the blood supply to the tissues.

:::

### Bleeding arm/hand

Feel between the muscles on the inner side of the upper arm. Push the artery against the bone, with an inwards/upwards pressure. Watch the
bleeding and adjust the position of your fingers until stops.

### Bleeding leg/foot

With the casualty lying on the ground, raise the knee of the bleeding limb and apply pressure to the centre of the fold, where the thigh joins the
groin. If you can’t find the bone with your fingers, use the heel of your hand. Watch the bleeding and adjust the pressure until it stops.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

ALWAYS elevate the bleeding limb, above the level of the heart, to make it easier to staunch serious bleeding.

:::

### Stab wounds

Most knife wounds involve slashing injuries and may lead to serious bleeding. Stab wounds caused by a knife or any other sharp object can be
extremely serious. The actual puncture may be small, but internal injuries are likely.

If the knife (or other sharp object) is still in the wound, do NOT attempt to remove it. Treat [SEVERE BLEEDING](#severe-bleeding) by
applying pressure beside the knife or around it. If there are other cuts or wounds, apply direct pressure to them. If bleeding is extensive, check
for [signs of SHOCK](#shock) Keep the casualty as calm as possible while waiting for help to arrive.

:::danger[Warning]

Do NOT move a casualty more than absolutely necessary, especially if there is a knife or other sharp object embedded in a wound—it could
cause further injury.

:::

### Gunshot wounds

If the ‘bullet’ passes straight through, the exit wound is often larger than the entry wound. Serious damage to tissues, organs, blood
vessels and nerves may result from any gunshot wound. Internal bleeding may be more extensive than external-watch for
[signs of SHOCK](#shock).

ALWAYS check to see if there IS an exit wound. Calm and reassure casualty.

- Deal with [SEVERE BLEEDING](#severe-bleeding) while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.
- Monitor [BREATHING](#breathing) and
- [PULSE](#pulse) until help arrives.

## **Shock**

Shock is caused by a serious and dangerous reduction in the blood flow or fluid levels in the body. It should NOT be confused with post-traumatic
stress disorder, which follows an emotional or physical trauma.

Severe bleeding, loss of body fluids from severe burns or from persistent/prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea commonly lead to shock. Shock may also
be caused by a heart attack/ failure of an artery or electrocution.

The priority is to encourage the supply of blood to the vital organs—the heart, brain and lungs.

### Shock symptoms

- Skin cold and clammy
- Casualty weak/dizzy/faint
- Pulse is shallow and rapid
- Casualty may be thirsty
- Vomiting/unconsciousness
- Skin paler than normal (greyish)
- Loss of colour in lips

You MUST act quickly. Do NOT excite the casualty in any way or move them more than absolutely necessary. Shock is life-threatening. CALL AN
AMBULANCE and apply first aid to BURNS or BLEEDING

### Action

Reassure the casualty as much as you can. Lay them on their back (if conscious) with legs elevated about 30cm (12in). Loosen tight/restrictive
clothing round neck, chest and abdomen.

Do NOT give anything to eat or drink. Cover to keep warm, but do NOT add heat-warming the surface of the body will draw blood away from the vital
organs which need it most.

Treat and monitor injuries, especially check breathing and pulse. If there is loss of consciousness, impaired breathing or signs that vomiting may
occur, place the casualty in the [RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position)(bearing injuries in mind), until help arrives.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Your attitude and actions are very important in treating shock. If you appear to be calm and in control of the situation, the patient will
feel cared for and respond. Stay with them if you can—NEVER leave a shock victim on their own.

:::

## **Heart attack**

This is a general term which is often used to cover any sudden, painful heart condition. An artery supplying blood to the heart may become blocked
or severely restricted. Part of the heart may die or the heart may stop.

### Heart attack symptoms

- Sudden, severe gripping pain in the chest (like extreme indigestion). Pain may spread to the shoulders, throat and down one or both arms.
- Casualty may sit down and seem withdrawn.
- Casualty clutches chest.
- Face, lips, hands and feet may lack colour.
- Sweating is likely.
- Breathing may be rapid, shallow and quiet, or may stop.
- Pulse (heartbeat) may be rapid, weak, erratic or may stop.
- Casualty may lose consciousness.
- Symptoms similar to [SHOCK](#shock).

It is VITAL to act quickly to reduce the amount of work the heart has to do. CALL AN AMBULANCE. TELL THEM A HEART ATTACK IS SUSPECTED.

Reassure and support the casualty, sitting down—if necessary on the ground against a wall. Raise the knees slightly. DON’T excite, worry
or move the casualty unnecessarily. Loosen any restrictive clothing. Monitor breathing and pulse until help arrives.

If the casualty stops breathing, loses consciousness or the heart DEFINITELY stops, be prepared to use

- [MOUTH-TO-MOUTH](#mouth-to-mouth) and
- [CARDIAC COMPRESSION](#cardiac-compression). When ‘stable’,
- place in the [RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position) until help arrives.

:::danger[Warning]

If the casualty stops breathing, loses consciousness or the heart DEFINITELY stops, be prepared to use —
[MOUTH-TO-MOUTH](#mouth-to-mouth) and — [CARDIAC COMPRESSION](#cardiac-compression). When ‘stable’, place
in the [RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position) until help arrives.

:::

### Stroke

In some cases, symptoms may be confused with the effects of alcohol (but no smell of alcohol will be present). Symptoms may develop suddenly over
a period of hours or, more rarely, days.

#### Stroke symptoms

Depending on the severity of the stroke:

- Headache, dizziness and confusion
- ‘Thumping’ pulse
- Unconsciousness or slipping into unconsciousness
- Drooping mouth, slurred speech, drooling
- Flushed face
- Pupils of the eyes unequal in size
- Casualty may urinate or defecate

You must act quickly. CALL AN AMBULANCE AND TELL THEM YOU SUSPECT A STROKE.

Reassure and calm the casualty. Lay them down with head and shoulders supported. Make sure saliva drains from the mouth—mop it up to make
the casualty feel ‘better’. Loosen any restrictive clothing.

Monitor the casualty’s breathing and pulse. If the casualty becomes unconscious, place in [RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position),
Be prepared to apply [MOUTH-TO-MOUTH](#mouth-to-mouth) if breathing stops, and
[CARDIAC COMPRESSION](#cardiac-compression) if heart stops.

## **Burns/scalds**

Extremes of heat/cold, electrocution, chemicals or radiation can cause burn injuries. Scalds tend to be caused by ‘wet’ heat such as steam
or hot liquids. The severity of the injury depends on the total skin area affected and the depth of the burn/scald.

### Severe burns

- Lay casualty down and protect burn/scald area from contact with ground.
- Cool affected area IMMEDIATELY with clean, cold water.
- Remove any rings/watches/belts or constricting clothing from injured area before swelling starts. NEVER remove anything that is sticking to a
    burn/scald.
- Remove any clothing soaked in chemicals—take care not to burn yourself.
- NEVER cover burn/scald area in fluffy dressing—use sterile dressing
- DO NOT break blisters/remove loose skin or interfere with injured area. Try not to touch burns directly.
- Do NOT put ointments/lotions or fat on burn/scald area
- If casualty becomes unconscious, place them in the [RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position).

:::tip[REMEMBER]

The conscious casualty with serious burns/scalds MUST be reassured and comforted and also treated for fluid loss. Give sips of
water—half a cup over ten minutes for adults. Children should sip water continuously.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

The risk of infection through damaged skin is VERY high in burn/scald injuries. Keep infection to a minimum by using sterile/clean dressings
and clean water to cool injured area. Shock can also develop in cases of large-scale burns/scalds owing to loss of body fluid. Watch for
[signs of shock and treat as for SHOCK](#shock).

:::

## **Recovery position**

When a casualty’s heart is beating and the casualty is breathing, place them in the recovery position to keep the airway open. This is
particularly important if the casualty is unconscious. If left on their back, a casualty is at risk of suffocation or choking by the tongue
falling back into the throat and blocking it, or by choking on their own saliva and vomit. Spectacles/loose dentures should be removed.

Face down, with the head in the correct position, the tongue will fall forward and fluids will drain from the mouth. You may not see any reason
WHY a casualty should vomit but it is common, especially on regaining consciousness.

:::danger[Warning]

NEVER attempt to roll a casualty into the recovery position if a head, neck or spinal injury is suspected. It is better to support the
casualty’s head in the position in which it was found. If breathing becomes difficult and there are at least six other responsible first
aiders, it is possible WITH GREAT CARE to attempt to turn the casualty over (see below). Try opening the airway first.

:::

ALWAYS monitor a casualty’s breathing-if it becomes laboured or noisy, the airway may not be properly open. Check the position of the
casualty’s head.

ALWAYS use the [recovery position](#recovery-position), unless you are examining the patient or applying first aid to other injuries.
While doing so, if there is breathing difficulty the recovery position is essential.

Draw the ‘upper’ arm and leg away from the body, to stop the casualty lying flat. Turn the head in the same direction, angling it back on
the neck (with jaw jutting out) to keep airway open.

Monitor [BREATHING](#breathing) and [PULSE](#pulse).

## **Spinal/neck injuries**

If there is a suspected spinal or neck injury and the casualty’s breathing becomes noisy or laboured, it is VITAL to try to open the airway.
ONLY try to do so if absolutely necessary! The ideal position for a conscious casualty is lying flat on their back with head supported at each
side. Try to lift the lower jaw with the head stationary. If this does not work, angle the head back and lift the jaw VERY GENTLY.

If breathing is very difficult, and there are at least six other responsible first aiders, attempt to turn the casualty. One person (you) should
hold the head, while three people position themselves on either side of the casualty.

VERY VERY CAREFULLY roll the casualty onto their side. The spine and neck must be constantly supported in the neutral position and NOT allowed to
twist or arch in any direction. Continue supporting the head until help arrives.

:::danger[Warning]

Spinal/neck injuries: If you suspect that a casualty has suffered a severe back/neck injury, extreme care should be taken in moving them. The
casualty should ONLY be moved if they are in more extreme/immediate danger-in a burning building for example. If possible, do NOT move the
casualty. Signs of severe back/neck injuries include a loss of feeling/movement below the injured area. A tingling/pins-and-needles sensation
in hands/feet often denotes a neck injury. There may be an inability to feel stimuli to skin, and breathing may be weak or laboured.

:::

## **Head injuries**

A heavy blow to the head, possibly causing bruising or bleeding, may also cause a skull fracture. A skull or brain injury is possible without
external signs. After a fall or other blow to the head, a casualty’s condition MUST be monitored for several days IN ALL CASES. Seek medical
attention.

### Concussion

Concussion is likely after a severe blow. Unconsciousness may or may not occur. Often a very brief period of unconsciousness may be taken for
granted—in other words, it’s over with so quickly that you tend to assume all is OK. But, the brain has been shaken and could be
damaged.

### Head injury symptoms

- Shallow breathing
- Loss of facial colour
- Cold, possibly sweaty, skin
- Rapid weak pulse
- Possible nausea and/or vomiting
- Possible confusion/loss of memory regarding the ‘accident’
- Possible unconsciousness

If unconscious, there is a strong possibility of vomiting. Place casualty in the [RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position)(if no
spinal/neck injuries are suspected). Monitor breathing and pulse. If consciousness does not return, check level of response by pinching some skin
on the casualty’s arm or hand. Look at your watch and note WHEN the casualty fails to respond to pinching or commands to open their eyes. It
could be important later on. There is a great likelihood of brain compression. SEEK URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION.

:::info[BLAST/EXPLOSION INJURIES]

If the casualty has been caught in the blast of an exploding bomb—or even a domestic or workplace explosion involving gas or
chemicals-there may be several types of injury.

While waiting for help to arrive, look for signs of fractures, head injuries, burns and lacerations from flying glass and debris. The lungs
and other internal organs may also be affected.

Reassure and calm the casualty. DON’T move more than necessary. Treat all injuries according to their seriousness.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Compression of the brain may develop hours or days after the initial injury. SEEK URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION.

:::

### Compression

If blood/fluid is building up inside the skull, causing pressure on the brain, symptoms may include:

- Strong slow pulse
- Numbness, tingling or paralysis of part of the body
- Flushed face
- Noisy laboured breathing
- Uneven pupil size
- Possible rise in body temperature

This is an emergency. CALL AN AMBULANCE. TELL THEM YOU SUSPECT COMPRESSION FROM A HEAD INJURY. If the casualty loses consciousness while you are
waiting for the ambulance, place in [recovery position](#recovery-position) and monitor breathing and pulse.

### Skull fracture

After a severe blow to the head-in a fall or motoring accident for instance-a skull fracture may result. Symptoms include:

- Similar symptoms to concussion and compression.
- There may be blood or straw-coloured fluid leaking from the nose, ears or eyes.
- There may be obvious surface signs on the head itself—a soft area, a depression or obvious fracture.

If no spinal/neck injury is suspected, place casualty in the

[RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position). If fluid is leaking from one ear only, turn the head to allow the fluid to leak directly
downwards. Be very gentle. Monitor breathing and pulse and look out for symptoms of [COMPRESSION](#compression).

This is an emergency. Call an ambulance. TELL THEM YOU SUSPECT A SKULL FRACTURE.

## **Chest injuries**

A chest wound can give rise to a life-threatening situation, which will require immediate action. Lung function may be impaired, affecting
[BREATHING](#breathing). A wound may cause [SEVERE BLEEDING](#severe-bleeding). Danger signals of a severe chest injury
include bright-red frothy blood coughed up by the victim, the sound of air being sucked into the chest and bloodstained liquid bubbling from the
chest.

Seal open wound with hand or a credit card. You may need to use quite a lot of pressure and maintain it until help arrives. Place victim in a
half-sitting position, support head and shoulders. Turn victim so that unaffected lung is uppermost.

Cover wound with sterile dressing—try to make dressing airtight by covering with plastic sheet or metal foil. Be alert for symptoms of
[SHOCK](#shock). If victim loses consciousness place in [RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position).

## **Drowning**

Not all drowning victims have water-filled lungs. In most cases, quite small quantities of water may enter the lungs. Occasionally the airway goes
into spasm as water tries to enter, thereby causing asphyxiation. When water does enter the lungs, it impairs their ability to transport oxygen
into the blood.

:::danger[Warning]

All people who have ‘nearly drowned’, but have been successfully revived, MUST SEEK URGENT MEDICAL ATTENTION. Delayed
‘drowning’ may occur up to 72 hours later, due to the presence of water in the lungs.

:::

Other effects of immersion may include hypothermia-which is life-threatening—and, if the casualty has been in the water a long time,
post-rescue collapse.

Post-rescue collapse is most common when a person has been in water for a long period and is suddenly lifted out (by air/ sea rescue, for
instance). The water pressure around the body is suddenly removed, causing the heart to work harder. In many cases this has led to tragic death
after a person has been ‘saved’, although rescue techniques are being modified to cater for this. Lifting the casualty in a horizontal
position has been found to lessen the effect of sudden removal from the water.

### Action: drowning

In most cases there is little water in the lungs (if any)-don’t waste time trying to get it out, GET AIR IN! You MUST act as quickly as
possible—if you can start resuscitation in the water, do so. Remove any debris in the casualty’s mouth and apply
[MOUTH-TO-MOUTH](#mouth-to-mouth). If [CARDIAC COMPRESSION](#cardiac-compression) is also necessary, get the casualty out of
the water—quickly.

Keep the casualty warm while waiting for help. When ‘stable’, place in the [RECOVERY POSITION](#recovery-position).

:::info[COLD WATER IMMERSION]

The cooling of the body’s core temperature will he greatly accelerated by the consumption of alcohol. It is estimated that a quarter of
all deaths by drowning are also partly due to the lowering of the body’s temperature that alcohol causes.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

The cooling of the body’s core temperature will he greatly accelerated by the consumption of alcohol. It is estimated that a quarter of
all deaths by drowning are also partly due to the lowering of the body’s temperature that alcohol causes.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

People have been resuscitated after ‘drowning’ up to 25 minutes later. NEVER give up attempts at resuscitation until help arrives. If
the water is extremely cold, the casualty may fully recover—the dramatic reduction in body temperature can actually protect the brain.

:::

## **Childbirth**

If you are pregnant, it is VITAL that you seek regular medical attention. Follow any guidelines or instructions given by your doctor in
preparation for childbirth. This may include changes in lifestyle—avoid physical and mental stress which can lead to premature
birth/miscarriage. Prepare an emergency procedure for getting help and medical attention.

Even though emergency medical response time in cities is short, pregnant women in difficulty MUST receive first-aid assistance. Slight vaginal
bleeding does NOT necessarily mean that a miscarriage is imminent—but medical attention should still be sought.

### Miscarriage

Spontaneous abortion of foetus before week 28 of pregnancy. Risks include severe loss of blood (leading to [SHOCK](#shock)), possibly
aggravated by the retention of some birth matter in the womb. Symptoms may include cramp-like pain in the lower abdomen, as well as vaginal
bleeding and perhaps passing of birth matter.

- Reassure and keep the woman warm.
- Position her with head/shoulders supported and knees slightly raised, supported by a cushion/blanket to take strain from abdominal muscles.
- Monitor pulse and breathing.
- Place clean towel or sanitary pad between her legs.
- If bleeding is severe, treat for [SHOCK](#shock).
- Save birth matter for medical examination later.

### Labour

It is quite possible for a woman to go into labour at any time approaching the expected date of birth. In most births, there is no threat to
mother or baby—but the warmer and cleaner the surroundings the better. There is usually time for the mother to be taken to a hospital, or
for the emergency services to arrive and ‘take over’.

Normally the birth process follows clear stages—but there is no ‘rule book’. Every birth is different.

:::danger[Warning]

It birth seems imminent, do NOT attempt to delay the emergence of the baby in any way.

:::

:::info[STAGE ONE]

This stage may take 12-14 hours for a first child, but less in a subsequent pregnancy:

- Cramp-like pain in abdomen/lower back
- Contractions of the womb every 10-20 minutes accompanied by a small amount of blood-stained mucus (a sign that the cervix has begun to
    dilate)
- ‘Waters’ break—the membrane containing the baby ruptures, discharging amniotic fluid

Once the ‘waters’ have broken—there may be a sudden rush of fluid or a prolonged ‘trickle’—this means that the
baby is being born. Prepare for emergency childbirth.

:::

The mother is likely to be anxious and frightened, particularly if it is her first baby. Help her to lie down with her head and shoulders
raised—use pillows, coats or have someone cradle her from behind. Restrictive clothing should be removed, especially from the mother’s
lower half.

Do what you can to arrange as much privacy as possible. Encourage the mother to draw up her knees, place a pad of towels, clothing or blankets
underneath her hips for comfort. Keep her warm as much as possible.

Hygiene is VERY important to mother and baby but, in the back of a taxi (for instance), there is only so much you can do. If possible, wash your
hands and use clean towels.

### Stage two

This stage can take up to an hour. Keep the mother warm, calm and reassured.

- During a contraction, encourage mother to grasp her knees and pull her head towards them, pushing downwards.
- She should relax until the next contraction.
- Contractions normally become stronger and last longer as labour progresses.
- The area around the vagina and anus will begin to bulge as the baby’s head approaches.
- The baby’s head will begin to appear—get ready, birth is about to take place at any minute.

### Stage three: delivery

Support baby’s head as it begins to appear and hold clean towel over anus (if bowel movement occurs, wipe faeces AWAY from birth canal to
avoid infection). Support baby’s head during each contraction. When crown (widest part) of baby’s head has passed through lower end of
birth canal, tell mother to stop pushing and start panting.

- Still supporting the baby’s head to prevent it emerging too quickly, clear membrane and birth matter from the baby’s face and check
    that the umbilical cord is not caught around the baby’s neck.
- Still supported, the baby’s head will turn to one side as the body moves into position to travel down the birth canal. By lowering the
    baby’s head, you can help the ‘upper’ shoulder emerge.
- By gently lifting the baby, you can ease out the ‘lower’ shoulder and arm.
- Hold the baby gently around its chest, lift it up and out of the mother, placing it on her abdomen.

:::danger[Warning]

DON’T pull on the umbilical cord-and BEWARE: The baby may be very slippery.

:::

- Gently clean out the baby’s mouth and clean mucus away from its nostrils. It should cry and breathe naturally. If it does, wrap it up to
    keep it warm and lay it on its side with its face down to allow fluid to drain from the airway.
- If baby does not breathe, apply resuscitation techniques. It is NOT advisable to slap the baby!

### Stage four

Afterbirth matter and the umbilical cord are normally released from the womb up to 30 minutes later, accompanied by mild contractions. The mother
can help by ‘pushing’ this matter out. DON’T attempt to speed up the process by pulling.

Leave the umbilical cord and placenta, wrapped, beside the baby. When medical examination is possible, the afterbirth matter is needed to check
whether anything has been left inside the mother—a potential cause of complications.

Clean the mother up and cover her. There may be some residual bleeding, but it’s not normally serious. Place a clean towel or absorbent
material between the legs. If bleeding seems more excessive, DON’T worry the mother. Massage her abdomen gently and reassure her.
