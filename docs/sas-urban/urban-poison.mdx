Danger lies in assuming that all household ‘chemicals’ are safe. Many preparations, from DIY products to over-the-counter medicines, are
far from safe if not used with great care. Even aspirin may have toxic effects.

## **Chemical hazards**

No one can avoid coming into contact with potentially-dangerous chemicals in the home. Most people have enough sense to treat all chemical
preparations with proper respect—but there are many cases of poisoning which could not have been foreseen. Most dangerous or
potentially-dangerous substances are labelled, but always remember: research into the harmful effects of all substances which are used in the
home, in industry and the environment is constantly providing new information. Once, substances such as nicotine, asbestos, lead, aluminium,
arsenic, opium and even mercury were thought to be harmless-or even beneficial to health!

#### Know the dangers

You may think that you never use dangerous chemicals, but the chances are that you do—everyday—and will continue to do so as part of
normal life.

It’s true that most household products have a fairly low toxicity (depending on the level of exposure and the sensitivity of the individual).
In some cases, you would need to ingest large quantities to be at risk. But exposure over a long period of time may be as serious in the end
result.

Quite apart from these dangers, always remember that you are under threat, it is now clear, from hazards in your water supply, and from pollution
in the environment. Some areas carry particular dangers from lead, cadmium or aluminium. There are also the domestic dangers from asbestos,
formaldehyde and carbon monoxide—even mains and cylinder gases. These may be aggravated by exposure to chemicals while at work (see
[WORK &amp; PLAY](/sas-urban/urban-work-and-play)).

### Alcohol

There is some form of alcohol in every home—either in the ‘drinks’ cupboard or in perfumes, aftershaves, surgical spirit. In small
amounts, it may be present in many aerosols, window and glass cleaners and cosmetics.

As a drink, in most countries, it is socially acceptable and pleasant—in moderation. Alcohol is NOT, as many people think, a
stimulant—it actually depresses the nervous system. Alcohol IS a poison. It damages the body. In particular, it affects the brain, liver,
heart and stomach. It can be very ‘addictive’ or lead to dependency. Externally, contact with alcohol in various products can lead to
dermatitis.

:::danger[Warning]

Milk tends to delay the effects of alcohol (especially the drowsiness) but, contrary to popular belief, coffee (caffeine) does NOT reverse the
effects of alcohol. Drinking coffee will NOT make it safer to drive or operate machinery.

:::

#### What alcohol does

Alcohol causes different effects in different individuals, but most of the following (to some degree) in everyone—when taken to excess:
reduction in coordination and control of muscles, and problems with reasoning, judgement and vision. It’s immediately easy to see why alcohol
is related to so many accidents. The ‘drinker’ is probably the worst judge of what is good for him or her once affected.

The heart rate is increased. There may be dehydration, depression or ‘manic’ episodes. Although you may look ‘flushed’ and warm,
there is a significant decrease in body temperature—which could be very serious (when swimming for example).

When alcohol is taken to excess, the poisoning can lead to unconsciousness, kidney and liver damage, heart disease or failure, gastric ulcers,
impotence, impaired brain and nerve functioning and death. Other side effects include raised blood pressure, obesity and severe depression.

#### Look at the facts

Alcohol is a very major cause of death by poisoning in adults, not just by ‘drinking and driving’. Poisoning does not always lead to
death, but is more likely to in conjunction with drugs. Alcohol ranks in the highest category of risks, with toxic fumes and exposure to gases,
such as carbon monoxide. A large proportion of violent crimes are alcohol related.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

It is not compulsory to drink. It is definitely not compulsory to drink to excess. If you don’t want a drink, when offered, say
‘no’. Social pressure often makes refusal difficult—but it is YOUR decision.

:::

One study shows that 50% of deaths in people under 25 are alcohol related. Teenagers regularly over-consume—leading to poisoning.
In children, alcohol ranks amongst the top causes of accidental poisoning, too—with turps/white spirit, disinfectants,
[pesticides](#pesticides) (rat poison, for instance) and bleaches. Nearly ALL children over ten, especially boys, will have tried
alcohol—knowingly. Young children will help themselves (more innocently) given the chance.

#### Bad combinations

Mixing alcohol with some other substances can increase dangers. Great care should be taken with all drugs, and medications such as:
anti-histamines, sedatives, anti-depressants, tranquillizers—even aspirin and codeine. The effects of these combinations may not be
immediate—they may not show for several drinks.

#### Major risks

- Never combine alcohol with drugs of ANY sort
- NEVER mix alcohol with breathing the fumes of a solvent
- NEVER (do you NEED to be told?) mix alcohol with driving or the operation of machinery—at home or work
- NEVER mix alcohol with swimming—quite apart from the risk of drowning, both lower your temperature. This heat loss may be fatal
- Pregnant women run an increased risk of foetal abnormality—especially if drugs are also taken

:::danger[Warning]

When a child swallows alcohol, or products containing alcohol, the level of sugar in the blood may drop abruptly-risking hypoglycaemia.
First-aid treatment should always include giving the child a spoonful of sugar or a sweet drink.

:::

#### Precautions

Store all products containing alcohol where children cannot reach them. DON’T allow children to play with perfumes, aftershaves or any
household product. NEVER store alcoholic drinks where children or anyone else who may be at risk may be able to get at them (see Safe storage).

:::danger

IF YOU THINK THAT YOU, OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW, MAY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL-[see HEALTH](/sas-urban/urban-health)

:::

### Types of hazards

Chemicals may be hazardous in a wide variety of ways. Obviously the toxicity of the chemical/substance is an important factor in judging
risks—but it should be possible to avoid exposure to many unnecessary dangers. For
[SUBSTANCE ABUSE see HEALTH](/sas-urban/urban-health#substance-abuse).

#### Inhalation

Chemicals in powder form, in smoke, in fumes and vapours and sprays all enter the system by the nasal membranes and the lungs—both are
routes for rapid absorption into the blood and tissues. Proper ventilation and breathing protection are obviously essential, especially during DIY
of any sort. Inhalation may also lead to ‘aspiration pneumonia’—inflammation of or fluid in the lungs—and various forms of
cancer.

#### Ingestion

Although ingestion may be deliberate, it usually occurs in adults from mislabelled containers and confusion. Children seem to put everything in
their mouths! Care must always be taken when handling chemicals to avoid hand-to-mouth contact—NO eating, drinking or smoking.

Hygiene is important—scrub hands, especially under the fingernails. NEVER use chemicals of any sort where food is prepared or stored.
Don’t store chemicals and preparations in a ‘shambles’, increasing the risk that the wrong substance may be drunk-or given to a sick
child in the middle of the night.

#### Absorption

Absorption through the skin (or broken skin) is a very real danger. The chemical does not need to be liquid to be absorbed. Often, warnings on
products are inadequate or unclear regarding the irritant properties of chemicals. Rubbing and scratching the area should be avoided. Always wear
gloves (which should be either washable or disposable) and cover up as much skin as possible. Washing is important after contact.

#### Fire/explosion

If the label says ‘no naked flames’-TAKE NOTICE! Fire and explosion are a risk with many chemicals, especially alcohols and solvents, and
also with fumes and dusts produced when working. Fire and explosion may lead to some of the other forms of poisoning. ‘Safe’ plastics in
the home—the foam in some soft furnishings or the PVC covering on flexes and cables, for instance, produce deadly fumes when burnt. Great
care should be taken when having bonfires.

Store flammable substances away from all sources of heat-even sunlight. This does not necessarily mean that they may burst into flames, but
chemical changes may take place which could be dangerous. Most very flammable substances may have a ‘flashpoint’—a temperature above
which they become particularly unstable. Store and use BELOW the flashpoint temperature.

#### Caustic burns

Many chemicals cause burns to the skin, soreness or damage to the eyes and internal burns. Chemicals do not have to be in liquid form to be
dangerous. Burning of the skin, mouth, throat and stomach may lead to rapid absorption into the body.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Chemicals in the home represent other dangers too. They may be misused in a variety of ways—many of which could be avoided with safe
storage or not having chemicals in a home where there is particular risk. Keeping some chemicals may be foolhardy where there are children,
old people, blind or poor-sighted people—or when there is a risk of substance abuse ([see HEALTH](/sas-urban/urban-health)), suicide,
arson and vandalism.

:::

#### Types of poisoning

Poisoning may be acute or chronic. It may be accidental-through inadequate warnings on the product, misunderstanding warnings or just not
comprehending how dangerous a product is. Self-inflicted poisoning may occur through longterm use of over-the-counter medicines. It may also be
deliberate-all manner of household products and drugs are used in attempts at suicide.

Acute poisoning occurs in a fairly short time, usually by ingestion (swallowing). With most household products the risks are low, unless a fair
amount of a substance is ingested—children/infants and elderly people are obviously at greater risk. But all cases of acute poisoning should
be treated as medical emergencies.

Chronic poisoning is the gradual accumulation of chemicals in the body. The body may have no way of eliminating these chemicals—particularly
in the case of babies and small children, whose systems are not fully developed.

#### Sensitivity

Some poisons will immediately be dangerous to everyone. Other, subtler poisons will cause different effects in each individual. People susceptible
to allergies, eczema, migraine or asthma may be particularly sensitive-and should take extra precautions.

Sensitivity may be ‘acquired’. For instance, you might suffer no ill effects from contact with a product which has a warning that it may
cause dermatitis. After using for a long period of time, you may develop a sensitivity.

People who take tranquillizers or sleeping tablets should avoid all contact with solvents, or fumes or vapours of solvents (<a
href="#solvents-in-the-home">see Solvents in the home</a>). Other drugs may also affect the way the body deals with toxic substances. If you are receiving any medication, ask the doctor/pharmacist if a
bad reaction or weakened resistance to any substance is a possible side effect.

#### High risk groups

Children under four are most at risk from accidental poisoning. They don’t understand danger, can’t read labels, put a lot of things in
their mouths. They will often sample substances which don’t look or smell at all pleasant. The younger the child, the less their physical
ability to cope with poisons.

Pregnant (and breast-feeding) women should take extra care. The foetus or baby can be harmed in many ways by drugs, alcohol-almost any chemical or
over-the-counter medicine. Some, such as solvents, find their way into breast milk.

Haemophiliacs may need to pay extra heed to ‘caustic’ warnings on products. Even aspirin can cause internal bleeding in some people. The
blind and poor-sighted should be given help to label, store and identify products.

The elderly may be unable to read warning labels, may forget having taken medicine and take an extra dose, may be unable to count or hold small
pills, may get confused and accidentally mix dangerous products. Dosages and maximum periods of over-the-counter medicines should be reduced,
since their bodies will not process chemicals so efficiently.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

DIY enthusiasts, gardeners and anyone who looks after a home may believe that the chemicals they use—such as paints, paint strippers,
drain clearers, solvents, [pesticides](#pesticides)—are in special weak ‘domestic’ concentrations. Because these
products are sold for home use, surely they must be ‘safe’? This is often quite WRONG. Many ‘industrial strength’ products are
common in the home.

:::

### Safe storage

The first objective is to store EVERYTHING out of the reach of young children and infants. That means all really nasty things like rat poison,
paints and DIY chemicals, solvents, drain clearers should be locked away-out of the home if possible, in a garage/shed.

Children, left alone for long enough, show a truly amazing amount of ingenuity in order to reach unreachable places. The classic is to pull out
drawers and use them as steps to climb up.

Most accidents with poisons have been found to occur when products weren’t locked away and were less than four feet from ground level.
Alcohol should NEVER be stored with children’s drinks. Remember: Young people are at risk from alcohol, as well as toddlers. Limit the amount
of alcohol in the home and lock it away. Children and young people WILL want to sample drinks which adults appear to enjoy. Quite apart from
poisoning, there are the risks of accidents and unconsciousness, once the casualty is intoxicated.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If you store products in locked cupboards, rooms or outbuildings, KEEP THE KEY HIDDEN. Otherwise the lock presents no barrier at all.

:::

Child-proof containers? It is accepted that up to 15 per cent of children will break through a child-proof top in five minutes. DON’T rely on
these containers to keep children out. If a bottle is glass or plastic, it could easily be broken or crushed underfoot-and the contents released.

Keep chemicals in groups-wherever you store them-to reduce the risk of using the wrong product for the job. In the dark, in a hurry, when sleepy,
you may take the wrong medicine, give the wrong drink to a child or spray caustic substances onto your skin. Keep anything toxic away from food
and areas where food is prepared. Keep anything flammable away from sources of heat (including sunlight) and away from power points, light
fittings and inflammable materials.

Herbicides and [pesticides](#pesticides) can be very poisonous. Children, in particular, have been known to drink paraquat.
Comparatively small amounts can be fatal.

#### Decanting

NEVER NEVER NEVER ‘decant’ chemicals or medicines into different containers. A high number of accidents occur through adults and children
mistaking the contents of containers. Relabelling is NOT sufficient. Labels may fade or fall off—and not everyone can see dearly or is able
to read.

A recognisable container such as a fizzy-drink bottle is still a fizzy-drink bottle to a small child—no matter what you write on the label.
And it’s just as likely that a thirsty adult could take a swig from a bottle without bothering to read the label. In some countries (including
the UK) it is now illegal to decant poisons into other containers. So it should be!

#### Medicines

Medicines which you are currently using-from cough syrups to birth control pills-are likely to be left lying around. NEVER do this where children
are about. The elderly may leave bottles open or pills within easy reach. Take care when visiting them with children.

Every home should have a lockable medicine cabinet. Some homes have a lot of ‘medicines’-so the cupboard may have to be quite large! It
should be strongly wall-mounted at a height which allows adult access, but deters small children.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

When storing caustic, flammable and highly toxic substances-even in the garage/shed—inspect the packages and shelves for signs of rot,
corrosion and decay. Some chemicals don’t age well. Containers may rust, inflate, crumble-or even explode. DON’T buy huge quantities
of chemicals. By keeping different sorts of chemicals separate from one another, you can reduce the risk of bad reactions occurring when two
or more of them mix-which could occur from natural seepage or spillage from old stored containers. Make sure the stored chemicals are not
subjected to heat or frost. Heat may alter the chemical nature of a product. Frost may crack a container.

:::

#### Disposal

Disposal of unwanted chemicals can be very tricky indeed. Medicines should be returned to a pharmacist/hospital, where they can be disposed of
properly. You may need to seek the advice of local authorities or environmental protection groups if you wish to dispose of really nasty
substances. Do NOT pour chemicals down sinks, drains or toilets. Contact manufacturers/suppliers for advice.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Medicines and chemicals in the waste bin are just as interesting to small children as the substances on high shelves.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

NEVER attempt to burn aerosols on a bonfire. Quite apart from the physical risks of the container exploding, when it does, residual chemicals
may be released.

:::

### Acute poisoning

Some poisons attack the central nervous system—causing problems with or even stopping the heart, breathing and other vital functions. Others
replace oxygen in the blood or prevent the ability of the blood to absorb oxygen.

#### Symptoms of acute poisoning

Some or all of these symptoms may be present. You may have to act quickly-so keep calm and try to be observant:

- Look for evidence-a packet / container / bottle / poisonous plant which could tell you what has happened.
- Or has the casualty been overcome by fumes or smoke?
- There may be delirium or convulsions.
- If the poison was carbon monoxide or smoke, the casualty may have a blueness or darkening of the face, lips and fingernails.
- If the poison was swallowed, there may be vomiting, stomach and abdominal pains, diarrhoea.
- Burns round the mouth indicate that a caustic substance has been swallowed.
- If this is the case, severe pain may result-all the way down to the stomach.
- You may be able to smell the poison on the breath-petrol, solvents, bleaches, disinfectants, shoe polish?

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If this is an attempt at suicide, the casualty may have had the opportunity to hide the ‘evidence’. Don’t waste time looking for
empty containers until help has arrived.

:::

#### You must act quickly

If there are symptoms of poisoning and discomfort or distress, call an ambulance and then begin first aid.
If the patient stops breathing, give [mouth-to-mouth](/sas-urban/urban-health#mouth-to-mouth) or mouth-to-nose artificial respiration.
Mouth-to-nose may help you avoid traces of poison on the casualty’s mouth.

If they have been covered in poison-such as a dense spray of insecticide—cover the face with a cloth and give artificial respiration through
a hole in it ([see Pesticides](#pesticides)).

If they are breathing, conscious or not, place them on their front with the head turned to one side and the chin jutting out. On that side, draw
the arm and leg away from the body. Even an unconscious person may vomit and block the airway ([see HEALTH: Recovery position](/sas-urban/urban-health#recovery-position)).

If there are burns and pain in the stomach and the casualty is fully conscious, up to a pint (half a pint for children) of milk or water may be
slowly sipped-but only if absolutely necessary. It may dilute the stomach contents and slow down the poisoning process.

Loosen restrictive clothing. Remove clothing contaminated by caustic substances, solvents and [pesticides](#pesticides). If there is
time, wash affected skin (avoiding exposing yourself to chemical dangers) BUT don’t allow the casualty to get cold.

#### Inducing vomiting

:::danger[Warning]

NEVER induce vomiting with salty water-for adults or children. Deaths have occurred by the dramatic raising of sodium levels in the body.
NEVER induce vomiting if a caustic/corrosive substance has been swallowed. What burns ‘on the way down’ will burn again on the way
back ‘up’.

NEVER induce vomiting it petrol or solvents have been swallowed. There is a danger of aspiration pneumonia if the substance enters the lungs.

:::

Inducing vomiting is generally considered a waste of time-and may do more harm than good. In the US, the use of ipecacuanha is recommended as an
emetic—or vomit inducer. In concentrated form it may poison a small child. It is not readily available in many countries, including the UK
where it is considered better to spend the time summoning help and applying first aid.

Inducing vomiting may be necessary, if you are unable to get help. It is probably only suitable in cases where children have very recently
swallowed tablets or poisonous berries. Putting your fingers very gently to the back of the casualty’s throat until the natural reflex takes
over, is the only way. Causing a casualty to vomit is very risky.

:::warning[SAVE A LIFE!]

ACUTE POISONING

<div className="text-center">
![ ](/images/sas-urban/img095_001.jpg)
</div>

WHEN THERE IS OBVIOUS DISTRESS, DISCOMFORT, VOMITING OR LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

- Do NOT induce vomiting
- Try to judge what has happened. How much poison is involved?
- Phone for an ambulance

CAUSTIC? If the poison has burnt the lips or mouth-moisten them with milk or water. Milk or water may be sipped.

KEEP AIRWAY OPEN! Even if the casualty is conscious, place them in the [recovery position](/sas-urban/urban-health#recovery-position).

BE PREPARED FOR CONVULSIONS, FITS OR VOMITING
IF BREATHING STOPS Give artificial respiration, [mouth-to-mouth](/sas-urban/urban-health#mouth-to-mouth) or mouth-to-nose. Avoid poison round
the casualty’s mouth.

Try to collect a sample of the poison and any vomit, for medical inspection

:::

### Chronic poisoning

Poison that has built up in the system over a period of time may be harder to detect. Much depends on the general health of the individual and the
poison involved. You should know better than anyone else if you are regularly exposed to dangers at work, like lead, solvents or
[pesticides](#pesticides). In the short term, you may notice that you feel ‘off colour’ when using substances, but after a few
days away from them you feel better again. This may indicate sensitivity or an allergy-but it is also telling you that you may be at risk.

Chronic poisoning may lead to a large number of varying disorders such as: dermatitis, asthma, regular headaches, respiratory complaints, cancers,
circulatory problems, gastrointestinal illnesses.

A thorough medical check-up should be sought if you think you are at risk. You should examine yourself regularly and decide whether you are taking
the proper precautions when dealing with chemicals. Even at work, safety procedures may be inadequate-or you may be especially sensitive to a
particular substance.

### Major risks

Look at the labels of products that you buy for the home. Read the warnings and obey all instructions. Exceed the precautions if you can.
Labelling of products for home use is strictly regulated. You know that, if a specific chemical is named, you are dealing with a
potentially-dangerous preparation. The absence of specific chemical names should not be taken to mean that the product is safe. Danger lies in
thinking that things you can buy for home use—especially medicines-must be safe.

You may be so familiar with a product, that you don’t bother to read the label at all. There ARE warnings on most toilet cleaners, for
instance, NOT to mix them with any other cleaning agents. A violent reaction might take place, producing choking toxic fumes.

Symbols have been developed to help you recognize hazardous substances at a glance. [See here](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#reading-the-signs).

:::tip[PLEASE NOTE]

The exclusion of any type of household chemical or medicine from the following lists should not be taken as an indication that such products
are safe. Almost any chemical can be dangerous, if used without caution. The following represents some of the most common dangers in the home.
Use the [EMERGENCY! panels](/sas-urban/urban-health#first-aid) for first-aid information and guidance.

</div>

SKIN AND EYE CONTACT

- Skin contact 1: Wash off as soon as possible with soap and warm water. Don’t scrub.
- Skin contact 2: As 1, but rinse the skin for several minutes to be sure all traces of chemical are removed or diluted. If area of skin
affected is large or becomes sore or a rash develops, seek medical attention.
- Skin contact 3: As 2, but rinse area for at least 20 minutes under running water. There might be ‘burns’—seek medical attention.

IF CLOTHING IS CONTAMINATED with caustic chemicals, solvents or [pesticides](#pesticides), remove it and wash affected skin but
don’t allow the casualty to get cold.

Eye contact 1: Rinse out the eye (with the lid held open) with cool running water for a few minutes. As soon as the eye irritation settles
down, you may need to seek medical attention.

Eye contact 2: As 2, but rinse area for at least 20 minutes under running water. There might be ‘burns’-seek medical attention.

IRRIGATING THE EYES must be done under a tap. Cold water will do but may be uncomfortable. Hot water will NOT do. Try to get to a mixer tap,
to get a gentle flow at about blood temperature—this is less unpleasant. A shower attachment may make the job easier. Even a bowl of
clean water splashed into the eye for a while will help. The process may be very traumatic for children or the elderly. Do the best you can
and seek medical assistance as soon as possible.

NOTE: In industry where goggles may not be possible, but eyes may be at risk, it is common to have a bottle of eye-washing solution fitted with
its own eyebath top. If you can find something like this to keep in the home for emergencies, it would be sensible.

</div>

INHALATION: GUIDELINES Take dizzy or nauseous casualty to fresh air. Loosen restrictive clothing. If symptoms don’t subside in a few
minutes, seek medical attention. Otherwise, keep casualty calm and warm.

IF CASUALTY IS VERY DIZZY, HAS SLURRED SPEECH, OR VOMITS  
Place in
[recovery position](/sas-urban/urban-health#recovery-position), to keep airway open. Cover to keep warm and call an ambulance.

INGESTION: GUIDELINES Small amounts of simple household chemicals may do no harm. Observe casualty for some time, give milk or water to
sip slowly and seek medical attention if there is any discomfort or distress. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING.

IF CHEMICAL IS HIGHLY TOXIC  
Even small amounts may be dangerous. Wipe away chemical from skin with water-especially if substance is caustic. Seek medical attention as soon
as possible. If obviously serious, an ambulance.

IF A LARGE AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL IS SWALLOWED  
If larger amounts have been swallowed, almost
any chemical may be dangerous. Keep casualty calm. Call an ambulance.

IF CASUALTY IS UNCONSCIOUS, BUT BREATHING  
Place in
[recovery position](/sas-urban/urban-health#recovery-position), to keep airway open. Cover casualty to keep warm and call an ambulance.

BE PREPARED FOR CONVULSIONS OR VOMITING  
If fits or convulsions take place, don’t let the casualty hurt themselves-particularly protect
the head. If vomiting occurs in a semi-conscious or conscious casualty, they may choke.

IF HEARTBEAT / BREATHING STOPS  
Be prepared to give
[cardiac compression](/sas-urban/urban-health#cardiac-compression) and artificial respiration. With a small child, place your mouth over
the mouth and nose of the casualty. Avoid the risk of poison around the casualty’s mouth.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Everyone who looks after children, the elderly or anyone with a recognized medical condition, should keep a note of emergency phone
numbers-including a doctor and the nearest hospital. It may be necessary for you to take a person to the nearest casualty department or
emergency room at a hospital. Do you know where it is? If you do a lot of DIY, are a crafts enthusiast, or use a lot of chemicals in the home
or garden, you should know what to do in an emergency.

:::

#### Acids in the home

Acids are common as constituents of many domestic cleaning products such as de-scalers (limescale removers), toilet cleaners, drain
clearers—even car batteries contain fairly strong acid.

Plumbers are fond of ‘spirits of salt’-it cleans metal very quickly. Some people use it to kill tree stumps or clean stone and quarry-tile
floors. It is actually a 32 per cent solution of hydrochloric acid, which produces toxic choking fumes.

If a product contains any named acid, follow directions very carefully, avoid skin contact and DON’T mix with other preparations. Most acids
are very caustic and cause burns to human tissue and often choking acrid fumes.
[See EMERGENCY! panel: Skin contact 3 / Eye contact 2](#major-risks). DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING

#### Alkalis in the home

These include sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), sodium hypochlorite, ammonia, potassium hydroxide, calcium oxide-in fact, any caustic or heavy-duty
cleaning product which does not contain a named acid is likely to contain a powerful alkali. Like acids, most produce burns on human tissue and
sometimes choking fumes. They are common in bleaches, toilet cleaning products, paint strippers, oven cleaners.
[See EMERGENCY! panel: Skin contact 3 / Eye Contact 2](#major-risks). DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING

#### Solvents in the home

Solvents are used in numerous products, from paints to glues, spot/grease removers to dry cleaning chemicals, aerosols to paint thinners, brush
cleaners to nail varnish. They evaporate rapidly, even at low temperatures. The vapours are toxic and can quickly make you dizzy or nauseous. It
is not safe to drive or operate machinery if affected. They are readily absorbed into the body where they melt fats and damage tissues.

Long-term exposure risks are liver and kidney damage. Even short-term exposure may cause memory loss and disturbed concentration. Overexposure may
cause headaches, vomiting, stupor or even hallucinations. Emergency treatment is required.
[See EMERGENCY! panel: Skin contact 1 or 2/Eye contact 1](#major-risks). DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Ventilation when working is top priority. If your job involves the use of solvents, you should be properly protected and have regular medical
check-ups to ensure you are not suffering long-term effects.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Some drugs such as sedatives, tranquillizers, sleeping tablets-even anti-histamines and alcohol-do NOT combine well with exposure to solvents.
The liver cannot process the chemicals and there is an increase of the narcotic effects (the dizziness, loss of concentration, stupor).
DON’T risk exposure if you are on medication. DON’T drive or operate machinery if you are affected.

:::

:::info[FORMALDEHYDE]

There is much debate on the safety of cavity-wall insulating foam-used in many countries. The danger is that (depending on conditions such as
moisture and humidity) it may release formaldehyde vapour. It is probably reasonably safe if totally contained-between two brick or block
walls-less so if used behind a flimsy partition wall. The official view varies from country to country-but links are being investigated
between formaldehyde and various forms of cancer.

Levels registered in all cases are very low-but it may be wise, if you are considering foam insulation, to make sure the contractor is a
registered user and his/her methods are covered by national seals of approval.

Formaldehyde is known to be an irritant of the upper respiratory passages. Symptoms may include: headaches, depression, insomnia, recurrent
coughs and colds, asthma and gastrointestinal problems. Old people and young children may be more at risk.

Several weeks after the foam has ‘cured’, the release of formaldehyde decreases. There is a background level of formaldehyde in most
homes—from processed woods like plywood and chipboard (which may offer problems to the DIY enthusiast or joiner—<a
href="/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards#angle-grinders">see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS: Wood dust</a>), resin glues for wood, qanoacrylate (instant) glues, resinous plastic and even foam-backed carpets.

:::

:::info[AEROSOLS]

The use of aerosols is a very sensitive issue in most countries-especially aerosols linked to damage caused to the ozone layer by propellant
gases. Safe alternatives should be sought, also, because there are immediate and long-term health risks to the user.

The mist of chemicals produced during spraying can enter the lungs. Quite common products may cause inflammation of the nasal and throat
membranes, asthma and chest irritations. There are plausible links to more serious chest complaints after long-term use.

Care should obviously be taken with hair sprays, throat sprays, deodorants and perfumes—any products which are applied directly to the
body, near the face.

:::

### Kitchen / living areas

#### Washing-up liquid/washing powders

These have fairly low toxicity. They could cause vomiting or gastrointestinal upsets. Inhaling bubbles could cause aspiration pneumonia. Skin
contact 2 or 3/Eye contact 2. DON’T hand wash with machine powders, particularly if they contain enzymes, as chronic dermatitis is a common
result. Always rinse off skin. The enzymes used not only break down proteins such as those found in egg or gravy but also body proteins such as
blood, skin and mucous membrane. Inhalation MUST be avoided. Skin contact 3/Eye contact 2

:::danger

REMEMBER TO REFER TO [EMERGENCY! PANEL FOR FIRST-AID GUIDANCE](#first-aid) THROUGHOUT THIS SECTION

:::

#### Oven cleaners

Usually highly corrosive—whether as sprays or impregnated into foam pads. They (commonly) contain caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). If
swallowed or inhaled seek urgent medical attention. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Skin contact 3/Eye contact 2

#### Shoe polish

The wax involved may cause gastrointestinal upset if swallowed, and diarrhoea. The solvents may include ethanol, toluene or xylene—which are
more serious. If swallowed by a child, seek medical attention. Skin contact 1

#### Mothballs/mothproofing

May contain naphthalene, which is highly toxic, or paradichlorobenzene—which is less so. May also contain permethrin (<a
href="#flying-insect-killer">see Flying insect killer</a>). If swallowed by a child and there is any doubt about the amount swallowed and the nature of the product, seek urgent medical attention. DO NOT
GIVE MILK to the casualty (or any liquid). Milk will speed the absorption of the naphthalene into the body. Mothballs (especially those containing
naphthalene) should be stored in the shed/garage. Skin contact 1 or 2

#### Bleaches

May contain caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), chlorine or ammonia. If swallowed, particularly by a child, give milk or water to sip and seek
medical attention. Fumes may be severely irritating to the eyes, nose and throat—avoid breathing them. NEVER mix bleaches with any other
cleaner—a violent reaction producing choking fumes may result. Skin contact 3/Eye contact 2

#### Liquid ammonia

A highly-unpleasant irritant that produces choking fumes. DON’T mix with other chemicals. If swallowed, seek medical attention, or give water
to sip. Judge by discomfort/distress/ amount swallowed. Skin contact 3/Eye contact 2. Seek medical attention if skin or eyes are ‘burnt’.

#### Glass cleaner

Products for mirror- and window-cleaning may contain petroleum-related products or alcohol and ammonia. If sprayed, avoid breathing mist as lung
damage may occur. If swallowed, medical attention may be urgent. Skin contact 2/ Eye contact 2

#### Felt-tip pens

Always make sure coloured pens given to children are NONTOXIC. Some contain solvents. Some may contain aniline dyes which could cause severe
poisoning if the pens are sucked. Breathing difficulties may occur and the skin would probably take on a bluish tone. Seek medical attention.

#### Matches

Apart from the obvious fire dangers, matches are also poisonous. The phosphorus in ‘strike anywhere’ matches may cause liver damage if
chewed. So-called ‘safety’ matches are less harmful—but could cause gastrointestinal problems.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Never store matches where children can even see them. Never store matches near any flammable substances.

:::

#### Glues

Most water-based glues for paper are non-toxic. Look for ones so labelled—particularly if children are to use them. Glues containing
solvents should only be used in the home under well-ventilated conditions.

Instant glues (cyanoacrylates) produce toxic irritant fumes which should not be inhaled. The toxic effects of these glues has not been fully
understood yet. The fumes may be linked to immediate or delayed asthma, but in domestic use the quantities used are very small. If the fingers
become stuck, trying to free them from an object or from each other might tear the skin. Tiny areas of adhesion may be gently eased apart in warm
soapy water with the aid of a blunt spatula or the handle of a spoon. Larger areas need MEDICAL ATTENTION. If any glue goes in the eyes or mouth,
URGENT medical attention should be sought.

‘Airplane’ or modelmaking glues and certain spray glues contain toluene—a toxic solvent. Avoid breathing the fumes. NEVER breathe in
the spray (a mask is advisable) as long-term use may well result in lung damage. If overexposed to the fumes of these glues there may be vomiting,
cramp, impaired breathing, loss of body heat and a reduction in blood pressure—even unconsciousness and death in some cases (usually only
when the substance has been severely abused). Skin contact 2/Eye contact 2

#### Butane

In many homes this is used to fuel: cigarette and gas-oven lighters, portable gas heaters, cordless curling tongs and some DIY blow torches. Avoid
breathing butane gas—and keep away from children, especially the small lighter-fuel-size cannisters. If inhaled to the level where vomiting,
headaches or slurred speech are occurring-get to fresh air at once and seek medical attention. Skin contact with the liquid gas may cause
‘burns’ similar to frostbite. Skin contact 2 or 3/Eye contact 2 (using WARM water). Seek medical attention.

#### Furniture polish

Solid kinds may contain white spirit ([see Turpentine substitute](/sas-urban/urban-safety-first#chemicals)), petroleum-related substances or other
solvents. Avoid breathing the fumes-or even excessive skin contact. Skin contact 1. Don’t breathe in the spray mist from aerosol
polishes—they may contain alcohol, or petroleum-related substances or silicone wax. The effects on the lungs could be severe. Avoid
ingesting any kind of polish. Small amounts may not do any harm, but urgent medical attention should be sought if a child consumes a large amount.
Skin contact 1/Eye contact 1

#### Disinfectants

NEVER use for medicinal purposes unless directed—and then ONLY as directed. If ingested, it could be very serious. The central nervous
system may be affected. There may be fainting or unconsciousness. The lips and all tissues down the throat may be very sore. Seek urgent medical
attention. Skin contact 2 or 3/Eye contact 2

#### Metal polishes

Most contain a solvent and ammonia. AVOID breathing fumes. Wear gloves during use and dispose of polishing cloths, which may also be contaminated
with toxic metal particles. Skin contact 2/Eye contact 1

#### Washing soda

Sodium carbonate is fairly caustic. If swallowed give water, followed by milk/egg mixture with a little vinegar. Seek medical attention. Skin
contact 2 or 3/Eye contact 2

### Bathroom / lavatory

#### Surgical spirit

Dangerous if swallowed—especially by children. Risks include lowering of blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) and possible convulsions or
unconsciousness. Medical attention may be urgently required—permanent damage to the eyes may occur. Give a child a spoonful of sugar or
glucose to boost blood sugar levels. Eye contact 1

#### Nail varnish/varnish remover

Contain solvents-often acetone. There may be sensitivity reactions to the nails and skin, with headaches and nausea from the fumes. Always apply
in a well-ventilated area. Ingestion is unlikely—but does occur. Monitor condition and seek medical assistance if necessary. Eye contact 2

#### Deodorants

Some people may be sensitive to the perfumes or alcohol (in some kinds). See the directions, which usually tell you NOT to use on sensitive or
broken skin. If armpits are shaved, the risk of a local reaction is dramatically increased. Anti-perspirants may actually block pores—and
lead to a severe infection. Never spray anti-perspirants all over yourself. You would interfere with your body’s cooling process. If in
aerosol form, do NOT breathe the mist. Many deodorants contain aluminium compounds. Aluminium is a potentially-toxic metal. Vaginal deodorants
(and bubble baths) have been linked with urethritis and cystitis. If a child swallows deodorant, seek medical attention. Eye contact 1

#### Perfumes / toilet water / aftershave

The danger arises mainly from the alcohol content. If enough has been swallowed, there may be a dramatic drop in blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and
possibly convulsions or unconsciousness. A child should be given a spoonful of sugar or glucose to boost sugar levels—and urgent medical
attention sought. Eye contact 1

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Many cosmetics may cause adverse reactions-from rashes and itching, to breathing irritation and headaches. Acute sensitivity to perfumes and
other ingredients may produce recurrent cold symptoms and regular headaches. If testing a new product, ALWAYS dab a little on a soft area of
skin—such as the inner forearm-and wait 48 hours before further application.

:::

#### Hair colourants and bleaches

ALWAYS follow the manufacturers’ instructions—particularly regarding sensitivity tests. DON’T take this lightly. A whole-head
application could be very serious and temporarily disfiguring if you have a bad reaction. Allergic/ dermatitic reactions are common. Sensitivity
may develop with prolonged use. Never use on a child without expert supervision. If swallowed, particularly by a child, give water to sip and seek
medical advice. Skin contact 1, 2 or 3/Eye contact 2

#### Talcum powder

Allergic skin reactions are common-especially in areas such as the armpit (particularly if it has been shaved). AVOID all cheap talc if not by a
known manufacturer. VERY strange contaminants have been found—even serious enough to cause death. Talc may contain potentially-toxic
compounds of magnesium and aluminium. Do NOT allow children to play with talc. Avoid ingestion or inhalation of airborne talc. If any rash
develops, discontinue use at once. Eye contact 1

#### Lavatory cleaners

May contain acids or alkalis, both strong enough to cause burns to the skin and eyes. May also contain ammonia, caustic soda or chlorine. If
ingested, lavatory cleaners may cause burns to the mouth and lips and throat, with severe damage to the stomach. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Give
water to sip. Seek URGENT medical attention. Skin contact 3/Eye contact 2

#### Hydrogen peroxide

The stronger the concentration, the more serious the effects. If swallowed, give water to drink and seek medical attention. Skin contact 3/Eye
contact 2. If skin or eyes are ‘burnt’, seek medical attention.

#### Alum

A powerful astringent. If swallowed, may cause gastrointestinal problems. Skin contact 2/Eye contact 2

### The medicine cupboard

Being able to buy ‘drugs’ over the counter at pharmacies—for some people—implies that the substances are ‘safe’.
Sometimes this is far from the truth. No product is intended to be used excessively or for a long time. Some may be completely unsuitable for
children or should only be used with care by the elderly.

In some cases, where these products are used to treat only ‘symptoms’, a more important medical problem may be masked—or new
illnesses/conditions may develop.

The information given here is very general. ALWAYS consult your doctor or medical adviser before using a product regularly. ALWAYS read
manufacturers’ instructions.

:::danger[Warning]

Suddenly ceasing prescribed medicines may produce harmful effects. Seek medical advice before doing so.

:::

:::tip[PLEASE NOTE]

Some types of ‘constant-use’ preparations can give cause for concern. If you rely heavily on any of the following—for any
reason—you should consult a doctor: pain relievers (including analgesics such as aspirin), cough and cold ‘cures’, nasal
decongestants and laxatives.

:::

:::info[MEDICINE SAFETY]

It should go without saying that anything which belongs in a medicine cupboard should NEVER be left where children could reach it. Even
adult-strength iron tablets (which may look exactly like sweets) can be extremely dangerous for a child. LOCK THE CUPBOARD AND HIDE THE KEY!
Also, avoid mix-ups by the elderly or poor-sighted by clear labelling and NEVER swapping drugs from one container to another.

If you are taking prescribed medicines of any kind, ALWAYS consult a doctor/pharmacist if you regularly use or intend to use any
over-the-counter preparations. Some chemicals may produce undesirable combinations in the body which could prove harmful.

Pregnant women and women who are breast-feeding babies under six months old should be wary of ALL drugs—even aspirin and
paracetamol-unless they are assured by a doctor that it is safe to take them. Many drugs will pass from mother to baby.

:::

#### Aspirin

It is now agreed (at least in the UK and US) that aspirin and products containing aspirin should NOT be given to children under twelve. Many
adults are sensitive and may experience gastrointestinal pain or problems, rashes or even asthma. Over use may damage the wall of the
stomach—possibly causing internal bleeding. Never take aspirin if you have a stomach ulcer. Taking aspirin regularly may cause you to
develop sensitivity. Aspirin (salicyclic acid) is a constituent of many other preparations including wart removers and corn ‘cures’-both
lead to absorption of the chemical into the system.

#### Paracetamol

Never take paracetamol if you have a history of liver or kidney problems. The main danger of long-term use is damage to the liver. Doses should be
very much reduced for children AND the elderly. Do NOT take paracetamol, even at the stated maximum dosage, for more than two or three days. If it
hasn’t ‘worked’, you should see a doctor in case you are taking the wrong medicine. Paracetamol is also a constituent of many other
preparations—always read labels!

#### Codeine

Not so commonly available these days, but should definitely not be over used. It is common as an ingredient in cough medicines and pain-killing
preparations. Dependency may occur—because codeine is an opium derivative. It may react badly with other drugs. Main side-effects include
constipation and drowsiness. In higher doses, there may be a clamminess of the skin or even loss of consciousness. The presence of codeine in any
‘medicine’ is usually clearly marked.

#### Indigestion remedies

If you need to take indigestion remedies frequently, you may have dietary problems. See a doctor. Common ingredients include: aluminium compounds
(aluminium is a potentially toxic metal), magnesium compounds and sodium bicarbonate. Constipation may result from aluminium-based preparations in
the short term, but links are being investigated with bone development problems and possible kidney damage. Magnesium is very likely to cause
diarrhoea, and may be toxic if taken to excess. The kidneys may suffer from long-term use. Even bicarbonate of soda should not be used on a
regular basis. It actually produces gas (CO2) in your stomach.

#### Diarrhoea remedies

Most are based on opium or belladonna derivatives and NOT designed for prolonged use. You may experience a dry mouth and giddiness. Rashes have
been known to be caused in some people. Treat with great caution and consult a doctor if you feel you need to take a medicine like this on a
regular basis.

#### Cough medicines

Codeine-based products should be used with extreme caution. They can lead to dependency. Antihistamines in these preparations will make you
drowsy—possibly very drowsy. By inhibiting coughing—codeine especially may prevent the lungs being relieved of mucous. Ephedrine is a
stimulant, with an adrenalin-like tendency to make you tense and nervous. It can react badly with other drugs. Ipecacuanha, seen in some
medicines, is an emetic (vomit inducer). It can only be presumed that high doses of medicine containing it may make you feel sick.

#### Hay fever/allergy remedies

Be VERY careful of the sedative effects of antihistamines— sleep may be unavoidable. Do NOT mix with alcohol or attempt to drive or operate
machinery. There may be gastrointestinal or urinary problems with long-term use.

#### Cold ‘cures’

Very high doses of vitamin C are not good for you over a long period. Problems may involve kidney stones, diarrhoea, stomach problems and
heartburn. There may even be a kind of dependence developed. Aspirin in combination with vitamin C may lead to further stomach irritation.

Try to avoid gargles and lozenges with iodine or borate in them—especially for children and the elderly. There may be toxic effects from
absorption.

Nasal decongestants should never be used for more than seven days. The nasal passages may be damaged—or even toughened up, and congestion
may become worse. Camphor-based products are NOT suitable for babies or infants.

#### Travel-sickness remedies

Most are based on antihistamines (see Hay fever/allergy remedies). Nearly all can cause severe drowsiness. Since they are taken when travelling,
there is a great danger that you may attempt to drive. You may fall asleep and miss destinations or not hear warning announcements. Regular use
should be avoided, except under medical supervision. Take great care with dosages for children and the elderly.

#### Laxatives

Taking laxatives is a rather old-fashioned idea. It is still very common and people should try to regulate bowel movements by dietary means.
Laxatives do NOT cure the cause of constipation. Users may become dependent, and not deal with the actual cause of their condition.

#### Vitamin/mineral supplements

These are NOT cures. They are NOT sweets. They are NOT intended to be taken in concentrated form over long periods. They are a dietary
supplement—NOT an alternative to eating properly. They are good as support when health is low or in times of illness. Problems of excessive
or very long-term use could be serious. If you feel you ‘need’ vitamins (in normal doses) for more than a couple of weeks, see a doctor.
There are already well-recognized side effects of many vitamins and minerals. Vitamins A and D, for instance, can be very toxic if over used. Do
NOT allow children to eat vitamins like sweets.

Germanium has been recently banned by law (in the UK, at least) and there is some doubt about ingesting selenium. Niacin has been shown to be
harmful in quite small overdose quantities. Always bear in mind that ‘food supplements’ are often not vetted/tested as drugs.

### Prescribed medicines

There has been a lot of debate about most prescribed medicines. Some undoubtedly ‘work’-but many produce side effects or bad combinations
with other drugs and may lead to addiction or dependency. Mild or serious overdosing may occur. Most people trust medicines and doctors enough to
believe that a course of medicines prescribed for them MUST be good for them. They will often carry on taking a medicine which disagrees with
them. If in doubt, go back to your doctor—there may be an alternative that could be prescribed.

More and more people are looking outside conventional medicine for ‘kinder’ cures and therapy. It may be that a ‘cure’ is more
frightening than the condition, in some cases.

#### Safety points

- NEVER share medicines with anyone else. Just because they are suffering a ‘similar’ condition, does not mean that the medicine is
appropriate.
- ALWAYS ask the doctor or pharmacist about the known side effects of a medicine. It is their duty to tell you.
- ALWAYS ask how serious it would be if someone else-perhaps a child—took the medicine by mistake.
- ALWAYS ask if the medicine might disagree with alcohol, coffee or over-the-counter medicines. Make sure you explain what you do for a living
if you are exposed to chemicals in the workplace as well.
- ALWAYS ask if addiction or dependence are possible.
- NEVER keep unwanted medicines. They may have a limited shelf-life and you shouldn’t attempt to start your own pharmacy. Take them back to
a pharmacist for proper disposal. Do NOT throw them down the sink or toilet.

:::info[DEPENDENCE]

Dependence on medication, especially tranquillizers, sleeping tablets and painkillers, is a very unpleasant predicament to be in. You may feel
unable to cope without the drug—and terrified of symptoms returning. You may even be physically addicted to a drug—your body may
demand it, while your mind is trying to tell you that you don’t need it. There are help groups and most doctors will be sympathetic. Quite
often there may be alternative safer medicines. You must have help to escape dependence on medication.

:::

### Garage/shed

All the ‘nasty’ chemicals for household use should be kept in the garage or shed—and locked away.

#### Glues

Solvent-based glues present a risk of inhaling the fumes. This can lead to dizziness and loss of judgement while working. Long term effects may be
more serious ([see Solvents in the home](#solvents-in-the-home)). If you are badly affected by fumes, do not over-exert yourself-your
heart may be at risk. Get to fresh air ([See EMERGENCY! panel](#major-risks)). Only use in a well-ventilated area. These glues are
also highly flammable. Continue ventilation until the glue is fully dry. Avoid skin contact. Do NOT use solvents to clean the skin. Extensive
contact may require medical attention. Soaking the affected area in soapy water may allow you to peel the glue away gently. (<a
href="/sas-urban/urban-health">See also HEALTH: Substance abuse</a>). Eye contact 2 or emergency medical attention

Two-part resin-based glues have been linked to asthma. Wash off before the glue ‘sets’ with warm soapy water or a skin cleanser. Try to
AVOID skin contact—chemicals may be absorbed into the skin. Skin contact 3/Eye contact 2 or emergency treatment

‘Hot melt’ adhesives can involve temperatures of 200&deg;C and produce deep burns. Wear gloves and protective clothing. Cool areas of
contact immediately with cold water—but don’t attempt to remove the glue. Don’t burn the glue—a toxic smoke is produced. These
glues do not have a long shelf life—old glue may ignite, in use.
[See EMERGENCY! panel: Skin contact 3 (but cool first and leave fixed patches of glue)/Eye contact 2](#major-risks) or emergency
treatment

Water-based (PVA) wood glues are known to cause dermatitis. Avoid skin contact. Wash from the skin before it dries. Wash/rinse immediately from
mouth or nose. If a large amount is swallowed, give casualty water to sip and seek medical attention. Skin contact 2/Eye contact 2

#### Tar/grease-spot removers

Most contain fairly heavy-duty toxic solvents such as tetrachloromethane, xylene or carbon tetrachloride. If swallowed may lead to
gastrointestinal problems and loss of consciousness. Avoid breathing vapours, which are also toxic—use ONLY in a well-ventilated area. If
affected, get to fresh air and seek medical attention if you don’t feel better in a few minutes. Tetrachlorethylene may be a constituent. You
MUST avoid inhalation or swallowing—or even prolonged skin contact. There have been many serious reactions. If affected, beyond a little
dizziness, seek medical attention. Regular exposure may lead to liver damage. Skin contact 2/Eye contact 2

#### Turpentine

Very poisonous. If swallowed, do not induce vomiting-seek emergency medical attention. May cause severe gastrointestinal irritation, breathing
difficulties and kidney damage. Urine may be dark and smell of turpentine. Use in a well-ventilated space. Skin contact 2/Eye contact 2

#### Turps substitute/white spirit

Similar to turpentine. Flammable. If enough is swallowed there may be lung irritation, fits, ‘drunkenness’ and headaches. In severe cases
there may be lung problems—even coma. Do not induce vomiting-seek urgent medical attention. Use only in a well-ventilated area. Skin contact
2/Eye contact 2

#### Petrol

If swallowed, severe gastrointestinal irritation and pain is likely. The vapour alone may cause damage to the lungs or pneumonia-like disorders.
Swallowing large amounts can lead to convulsions and unconsciousness. NEVER induce vomiting-the risk to the lungs is severe. NEVER syphon petrol
by sucking on a tube. Highly flammable/explosive. Use in a well-ventilated area. Skin contact 2/Eye contact 2

#### Caustic soda

Sodium hydroxide. Used as a super-strength cleaner and drain clearer. Also the main constituent of paste paint strippers. It can react violently
to acids or bleach. NEVER use in the toilet with other chemicals. Caustic soda produces a violent exothermic (heat-producing) reaction with
water—the right concentrations will reach ‘boiling point’ very quickly. This substance is HIGHLY CORROSIVE. Do NOT breathe in the
powder. If swallowed, do NOT induce vomiting. Give milk or water to sip—1/4 litre (1/2 pint) maximum for children and seek urgent medical
attention. Skin contact 3 (urgent)/Eye contact 2 (urgent-permanent damage is possible)

:::danger[Warning]

When mixing caustic soda, always add caustic soda crystal to water- NOT water to crystals. A violent reaction may occur, with droplets of hot
caustic liquid ejected.

:::

#### Paste paint stripper

[See Caustic soda](#caustic-soda)

#### Liquid paint stripper/brush cleaners

Liquid strippers may contain methanol (methyl alcohol). Lowering of the blood pressure, headaches and nausea are common. If swallowed, damage to
the eyesight may occur. Caustic effects may be very serious-do not induce vomiting. Give water to sip. Seek urgent medical help. May also contain
dichloro-methane, which affects the central nervous system and may be absorbed readily by the skin or by inhalation. Skin contact with all paint
strippers is painful ([see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards)). Serious dizziness may occur, making it unsafe to work—with
long-term use the heart and lungs are at risk. Skin contact 3 (NOT hot water!)/Eye contact 2 (urgent)

#### Antifreeze

May contain methanol but more likely ethylene glycol, which is highly poisonous. Unfortunately, it has a sweetish taste and a bright
colour—so children may be very interested. It is extremely dangerous if swallowed. Seek urgent medical attention. Observation is recommended
for at least 48 hours. All manner of serious effects may occur from oxalic acid formed in the system—affecting soft tissues, kidneys, brain
and heart. Giving a small amount of whisky or brandy to drink (these contain ethyl alcohol) should slow the progress of the ethylene glycol into
the blood. Seek medical help first! Skin contact 2/Eye contact 2

#### Methylated spirits

Contains ethyl alcohol, methanol (which can cause permanent eye damage) and pyridine. See Surgical spirit. Skin contact 2/Eye contact 1

#### Rust removers

These are highly poisonous and highly corrosive. Avoid all skin and eye contact. Swallowing could be very nasty indeed, with burning pains and
vomiting. Do NOT induce vomiting. Skin contact 3 / Eye contact 2 (urgent)

#### Slug and snail killers

May contain metaldehyde. Highly toxic. It is unlikely to be swallowed by humans in sufficient quantities to do harm, but may cause
gastrointestinal problems, fainting, nausea or breathing difficulties. Medical attention is more likely to be needed for small children. Dogs may
be at risk.

#### Rat/mouse poison

This rates high on the lists of dangers to children. Poisoning in adults is rare. The main constituents are anti-coagulants-agents which prevent
blood clotting, such as warfarin. Symptoms are blood in the urine and faeces or bruising. NEVER have these poisons in the home if there are
children about. A serious infestation of rats or mice should be dealt with by a local authority or specialists.

#### Firelighters

May contain’ metaldehyde ([see Slug and snail killers](#slug-and-snail-killers)), waxes and petroleum spirit, turpentine, paraffin
or solvent to ensure burning. Store in a cool well-ventilated space. May be serious if swallowed by a child, causing gastrointestinal problems,
pain and vomiting. Do not induce vomiting-seek urgent medical attention. Skin contact 1 and 2

#### Ant killer

May contain borax or pyrethrum. There may be an allergic reaction with skin irritation. Avoid skin contact and breathing dust. Pyrethrum may cause
(in children) excitability or trembling—but usually only if large amounts have been swallowed. Seek medical attention. Skin contact 2/Eye
contact 1

#### Flying insect killer

Usually contains pyrethrum, permethrin or other similar insecticides. See Ant killer. Avoid breathing mist from aerosol types. Skin contact 2/Eye
contact 2

#### De-icer

May contain isopropanol or methanol (see Liquid paint strippers). You may experience dizziness. If affected, do NOT drive. Avoid skin contact.
Seek urgent medical attention. Skin contact 2 or 3/Eye contact 2

#### Cement

Avoid skin contact. Cement is very alkaline when wet and can cause painful burns. Always wear waterproof gloves and avoid breathing the dust. Skin
contact 3/Eye contact 2

#### Plaster and fillers

Plasterers often have severe dermatitis, which is common from constant handling of alkaline materials (see Cement). In addition, as plaster dries
on the skin, it may ‘pull’ moisture from it. Always wear gloves or a good barrier cream. Skin contact 2 (before it dries hard)/Eye contact
1 or 2 (at once). Interior decorating fillers may contain fungicides and ‘resins’ which will further aggravate dermatitis.

#### Lime (calcium oxide)

Avoid skin and eye contact, inhalation and ingestion. Lime is VERY alkaline and will burn the skin. When combined with water, it produces heat and
calcium hydroxide—an irritant gas. IF LIME GETS IN YOUR EYES, treat as an emergency. Skin contact 2 or 3/Eye contact 2 (urgent)

### Pesticides

Pesticides and herbicides may be some of the most - unpleasant and dangerous chemicals we ‘use’. There are ‘organic’ or natural
alternatives, but a whole industry has been built around these toxins—for domestic as well as commercial use.

Pesticides include all products which control or eradicate unwanted insects/small animals. Herbicides are used to kill weeds (or unwanted plants)
and fungi—as in timber treatments or the control of algae growths on stone and masonry.

DON’T be casual about the use or storage of these chemicals. You should always consider:

- Is this the right product for the job?
- Do I need something this powerful? Is there a weaker alternative?
- Is this the smallest amount I can buy?

:::danger[Warning]

Never experiment with poisons-only use as instructed. NEVER mix products together to ‘kill two birds with one stone’-you may kill a
lot more than two birds. NEVER NEVER NEVER decant pesticides into other containers. In some countries, including the UK, this is prohibited by
law.

:::

#### Poisoning

Many [pesticides](#pesticides) involve a solvent as a ‘carrier’, confusing the symptoms of poisoning (<a
href="#solvents-in-the-home">see Solvents in the home</a>). Immediate risks are skin and eye irritation. All the main routes to the system are open to [pesticides](#pesticides), though.
Inhalation is common, of the mist when spraying, or of dust in dry chemicals. Tastes in the mouth and nasal irritation are early warning signs
that you SHOULD be wearing a mask.

Ingestion may be accidental or deliberate—or even a gradual process involving hand-to-mouth contact (eating/ drinking/smoking while working)
or incomplete washing of the hands and fingernails. Wear gloves! [pesticides](#pesticides) may also enter the system if they have been
deposited on or assimilated into fruits and vegetables.

Absorption is also highly possible. Don’t wait for skin irritation to signal danger. You may not feel skin discomfort until you have been
using a product for some time. Cover all skin—especially the hands and arms.

#### The legacy

Some [pesticides](#pesticides) are known to persist—but research may take many years to reach definite conclusions. It is certain
there may be long-term effects to the planet, to animals and to man, in terms of disease and other toxic effects. 2,4,5-T has now been withdrawn
or banned in many countries, because of links with birth defects and cancer. Even a new-born baby has traces (in the fatty tissues) of the
now-withdrawn and banned DDT.

#### Disposal

Never pour chemicals, particularly [pesticides](#pesticides), down any drain (sink, lavatory or street). They should NOT be introduced
into rivers, streams or the sea. If they enter your septic tank, they may kill off the necessary bacteria there.

If you have more than a ‘little’ to dispose of or are unsure about disposing of unfinished packets, cans and bottles, get in contact with
your local authority—or environmental concern groups—for their advice.

#### Using safely

- Don’t mix [pesticides](#pesticides).
- Don’t store in the wrong containers.
- Keep children and animals away from treated areas. Only spray what you need to, where you need to and when you need to.
- Keep the spray aimed where you need it—ALWAYS using a coarse spray, NOT a fine mist.
- Spray gardens early morning or late evening when few pollinating insects (or the birds that eat them) are about.
- Don’t spray in a breeze or wind. Spray drift may do damage. Protect yourself.
- Always wash all exposed skin after using.
- Don’t eat, drink or smoke until you have washed.
- Gloves should be in good condition and washable or disposable. Absorbent and damaged gloves may present a long term health hazard.
- Always wash out spray equipment and watering can to avoid contamination. If you can keep separate equipment for
[pesticides](#pesticides), it would be sensible.
- Always wear goggles and a breathing mask when spraying, or mixing dry ingredients.

#### First aid

Acute poisoning is rare—but if chemicals are breathed in or swallowed, the casualty should be observed. If there are any
effects—particularly in a child—medical attention should be sought.
[Refer back to EMERGENCY! panel for treatment details. Skin contact 1, 2 or 3](#major-risks) (Don’t forget to wash your scalp/
hair) Eye contact 2

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If you use [pesticides](#pesticides) regularly—perhaps as part of your work—you MUST protect yourself from constant
exposure to the toxins. A regular medical check-up would be sensible to ensure you are not suffering long-term effects. Some
[pesticides](#pesticides) may contain mercury or arsenic compounds or other cumulative poisons (which collect in your system).

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Sodium chlorate and potassium chlorate weedkillers are explosive-particularly in the dry state. They may explode or cause fire if dropped or
shaken violently. Both are highly toxic- swallowing either of these may be followed by abdominal pain, confusion and convulsions. A
surprisingly small amount may kill. Call an ambulance immediately, if a child appears to have swallowed some.

Paraquat is a very common weedkiller. It is often used very casually-but is highly toxic if swallowed.

:::

:::info[FERTILIZERS]

Many fertilizers for plants should be mixed, applied and stored with the same caution as for [pesticides](#pesticides). Many are
poisonous. Particular caution should be used with nitrate fertilizers, which are considered to be a major hazard to the environment. They are
a danger in domestic water and ‘over-fertilized’ fruits and vegetables. They become toxic in the body (as nitrites) and may be linked
to some cancers.

:::

## **Poisonous plants**

You may come across poisonous plants in domestic gardens, parks and growing ‘wild’ on verges—in some cases you might choose one as
an ‘indoor’ plant. Toxic effects range from skin irritation to death. Many of these plants may be attractive to children.

The amount of physical harm caused by these plants will depend largely on the age and general health of the casualty. It also depends on the
toxicity of the plant and the sensitivity of the individual. Always seek medical attention if there is any doubt—especially if you think a
child has swallowed a harmful substance. Take a sample of the ‘poison’ with you.

The following group of plants not only illustrates the amazing diversity of poisonous plants, but also represents some of the most common hazards.

### Food plants

Many of the plants that form part of our regular diet are potentially toxic, especially when eaten raw. The potato and tomato are both members of
the nightshade family (_Solanaceae_), which produces many extremely poisonous plants. Potato tubers become green and highly toxic when sufficiently
exposed to light—killing many people (especially children) each year. The fruits of tomato plants are not harmful when ripe, but the stems
and leaves are poisonous. Rhubarb leaves are extremely poisonous, but the stems are quite safe to eat after they have been cooked.

:::warning[REMEMBER]

Some plants are extremely poisonous to everyone. With many plants, however, the toxic effects depend greatly on the sensitivity of the
individual. Some people may be highly allergic to some species-even apples, tomatoes or strawberries may provoke a violent reaction.
Unfortunately, in these cases, the casualty only discovers the allergy when the (possibly dangerous) symptoms develop.

Many of the potentially-deadly plants, such as foxglove, have very unpleasant tastes or odours—which is a deterrent to most people.
Animals are nearly always aware of the warnings given by taste or smell, but children may be attracted by colourful or unusual seeds, leaves
or berries. Very small children are highly inquisitive and likely to ignore a nasty taste or smell.

:::warning[REMEMBER]

If you suspect that you or someone else has been poisoned by a plant, seek urgent medical assistance. Do NOT wait to see if the problem
‘gets better’. If possible, take along a sample of the plant believed to have caused the poisoning.

Use gloves to place the sample in a plastic bag. Don’t restrict the sample to a few leaves. If there are flowers or berries, take those
along as well. This will enable the plant to be IDENTIFIED quickly. Make a note of where the plant was found-this may help speed up its
identification.

:::info[Be safe]

It is impossible not to come into contact with poisonous plants—they are so numerous. Get to know as many species as possible in your area. When
arranging a garden, especially if children will play there unsupervised, plan it carefully and try to make it as safe as possible.

When buying new plants for your garden, check to see if they are poisonous. Make a note to position them away from the fronts of borders, where
children might touch them.

Don’t plant trees with poisonous seeds near garden ponds. Laburnum will poison fish.

DON’T put poisonous plants, especially members of the arum family and plants such as poison sumac (_Toxicodendron vernix_), poison ivy
(_T. quercifolium_) and poison oak (_T. radicans_), on bonfires. Inhalation of the smoke can be FATAL.

Don’t eat any plant that cannot be positively identified as a food. Some plants may resemble known food plants. For instance, the leaves of fool’s
parsley (_Aesthusa cynapium_) resemble parsley, and the roots of white bryony (_Bryonia alaba_) look very like turnips.

ALWAYS wash your hands in worm soapy water after handling plants.

### Rose family _rosaceae_

This family includes many common fruit trees. The seed kernels contain cyanogenetic glycosides, which break down into prussic acid. Poisons cause
numbness, tingling in the mouth, abdominal pains, vertigo, vomiting, purging and paralysis. Can be FATAL if large quantities are consumed.

### Risky houseplants?

Many plants that are grown indoors or in conservatories are poisonous, but no one need ever come to harm, if sensible precautions are taken.

Keep young children away from them. Especially at the crawling stage, children put everything they touch into their mouths.

When propagating plants that are known to have poisonous sap, wear gloves. Wash them afterwards. DON’T allow sap to enter cuts.

## **Poisonous fungi**

Most fungi are associated with trees or decaying wood. The mushrooms or toadstool-like form we see is only the fruiting body—a large part of
the fungus consisting of fine threads, the mycelium, spreading underground.

Here are some of the more poisonous types in Europe, the US and Australia—they are NOT the only ones. Fungi from some areas are not well
documented. The toxicity of even Australian species, for example, has not been extensively investigated.

Eat ONLY fungi that you can positively identify as SAFE. Some poisonous kinds look very like edible ones—DON’T GUESS.
ALWAYS avoid small or large brown mushrooms, especially if the gills below the cap are purple-brown or pink. Discourage children from eating or
touching any fungi found growing in the city.

Never underestimate the deadly toxicity of poisonous fungi—you don’t necessarily need to eat a large quantity to be poisoned. What’s
more, not all poisonous fungi have an unpleasant taste so it’s easy to be fooled into believing you’re eating an exible variety. You may
not even realize you’ve been poisoned until 8 to 14 hours later with some deadly fungi, when the first symptoms start to develop (perhaps
abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea). For some poisonous fungi there is no known antidote.
