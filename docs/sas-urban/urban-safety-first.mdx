You may think that you’re safe at home, but statistics indicate otherwise. The number of serious injuries and fatalities is staggering. Take
steps to prevent yourself, your family and visitors from coming to harm.

## **SAFE AS HOUSES?**

Most people think of the home as the one place where they can feel safe and secure—but statistics show that in industrialized societies
there are as many accidents in the home as on the roads. In Britain alone, one person in 30 will have a serious accident in the home. Hospitals
treat at least three million domestic injuries—and, since some result in visits to the doctor or self-help, the actual number of accidents
may be much higher. Even in the garden, over 90,000 accidents are reported, ranging from slight to fatal.

#### Types of accident

Everyone is at risk, but children and old people particularly so. The young are inquisitive and full of energy, while older people can quite often
be handicapped by poor eyesight, bad hearing and slower reactions.

A quarter of a million British children require hospital treatment for accidents which result from the structure of the house itself-falling and
head injuries from hard edges and corners of furniture.

Children at play around the home will have quite surprising accidents-most of which cannot be foreseen. Most hurt themselves by falling, tripping
or slipping on a flat surface. Statistics are lower for falls from one level to another, such as out of a window. Next come injuries against
objects such as the corners of tables, followed by cuts and deeper wounds, suffocation, poisoning and burns.

#### It’s up to you

People spend an average of 16 hours a day at home, so make sure yours is safe. Keep it properly maintained—put right any problems that
increase risk. Make sure that you do not create new dangers as you make changes or improvements.

Most occupations and areas of work are covered by stringent safety laws. These should always be followed and it is not totally up to you to ensure
that you are protected from injury. But in the home, safety is largely a matter of common sense and personal discretion.

There are rules and regulations regarding the structure itself, but these have changed over the years and older dwellings may (quite literally) be
deathtraps. Correctly installed and maintained gas, electrical and other services should be safe—but wear and tear on these, added to the
possibility of human error, could be lethal.

Surveyors will tell you if a structure is safe or not, but no one will come to your house to check for worn electrical flexes, loose stair carpets
and slippery floors. You are unlikely to be arrested for not paying due attention to an old and weak ceiling which could collapse. It is up to YOU
to judge these things for yourself or call in an expert when in doubt. Don’t wait for something to happen!

Many household accidents could be avoided with a better understanding of the risks involved—an increased awareness of dangers which could
seriously affect the lives of the occupants of your home.

### THE STRUCTURE

Keeping your house in good repair is not just a matter of maintaining market value. Damage, defects and decay could create a serious risk to life
and limb. When you buy a house it is usually thoroughly inspected by a qualified surveyor, but no one can spot every potential problem, nor
predict exactly how a building will behave as time passes and external conditions change.

Every structure ‘settles’ throughout its lifetime. This settlement is caused by the sheer weight of materials used in the construction,
but is also affected by changes in the use of the building—floors and walls are affected by heavy traffic and the positioning of unusually
heavy furniture. This process can be accelerated by environmental and local conditions. If you are worried about the safety of your home, it would
be worth seeking professional advice.

There are several ways in which the very location of your home may be a severe threat:

#### Vibration

Trains, heavy traffic, roadworks and even low-flying aircraft can progressively weaken the fabric of a building. If you can feel
vibration—and it’s not uncommon to ‘hear things rattling’ as a train passes—then your home is under threat.

Numerous factors determine the seriousness of such vibration. If a building has been next to a railway for 75 years and shows no serious damage,
it may never do so. However, the type or intensity of rail traffic may change over the years and new problems may develop. Expect problems in new
buildings when local conditions change for the worse.

Bombs, other explosions and earthquakes may do great damage, although the real extent of it may not be visible.

#### Clay soils

The main problem with clay subsoils is that they expand when wet and contract when subjected to drought. Shrinkage can be substantial in dry
seasons, causing foundations to sink. When a period of wet weather follows, the clay expands, eventually lifting the foundations back up again.
This may not be too serious if the shrinkage and heave occur evenly under the house, but uneven movement can be disastrous. A leaking water pipe
on one side of a structure would cause local swelling of the clay. More surprisingly, a large tree near a house will ‘drink’ up vast
quantities of water, causing local shrinkage.

Obviously a leak in a pipe must be located and fixed, but dealing with trees is more difficult. Remedies range from cutting down the tree, to
severe root pruning. Sometimes the remedy only makes matters worse. With the cause of the shrinkage removed, the clay takes on water and begins to
heave. This process could take several years, but will cause damage. Always consult an expert.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If you are planting a tree near a house, and you expect the tree to achieve any appreciable size, it should not be planted within 10m (over
30ft) of the foundations. Even when not on clay soils, the roots of a tree can cause havoc. Willow will target the slightest leak in a buried
water or drainage pipe and could cause damage.

:::

#### Chalky/sandy soils

In severe winters, chalky and sandy soils may be subject to ‘frost heave’. As they take on water and freeze, they expand-with enough power
to lift foundations. This problem is fairly rare and mainly affects unheated buildings.

#### Marshy ground

Whether the building is built on known marshy ground, possibly on a valley floor or foot of a hillside, or in close proximity to a river or lake,
it must be expected that problems will occur. New buildings should be built with the possibility of gradual sinking taken into account.
Underground rivers or bodies of water may be harder to detect.

#### Mining

Mining or tunnelling. Dramatic settlement may be expected when mining has been close to the surface. This may not be a gradual
process—numerous instances of sudden subsidence have been reported. You should know if your area was once or is still being mined.

#### Sloping ground

Building on hill and mountain sides may be no problem at all. All over the world there are buildings which have stood in precarious positions for
centuries. However, there are also numerous instances of sudden collapse, usually associated with mudslides after heavy rainfall.

#### Landfill

Much depends on the quality of the landfill. All sorts of problems have been reported, from sudden subsidence to underground explosions of
decaying matter. These are impossible to predict. There is also the possibility of toxic substances percolating up through the soil.

:::info[SUBSIDENCE AND SETTLEMENT]

All buildings settle in response to movement in the earth and expansion and contraction of their own structure. This can produce sloping
floors with doors, windows—even walls—out of alignment. Many old buildings survive like this for centuries—think of the
Leaning Tower of Pisa.

Any new or sudden movements, generally indicated by a crack of growing length or width, or creases or splits appearing in wallpaper at
corners, should be investigated. Recent very dry, hot summers in temperate countries have dried out soils and greatly increased the number of
properties affected by subsidence damage.

Any crack, especially a new one, should be investigated—or even monitored over a period of weeks or months to ascertain the cause.
Don’t assume that the building is falling down—but don’t ignore the cracks either. Monitoring may involve marking the crack in
some way to work out the direction of movement. A crack in an external wall will let in damp and this could lead to further problems.

Consult an expert such as a surveyor or a professional builder. Your insurance company may be able to advise, but many policies do not allow
for the effects of subsidence and settlement.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Climbing plants, partcularly ivy, should not be allowed to scramble unchecked over the outside of a building. If the walls are in good
condition or the bricks and mortar are new, there should not be much problem. The aerial roots will invade bad joints or cracked rendering,
expand and severely weaken a wall. Eventually, the weight of old plants (stems can grow as thick as your neck!) could pull a wall down.

Care should be taken to avoid ivy invading the spaces around the eaves of the house, spaces between slates, tiles, flashing and
weatherboarding. As the roots and stems expand they will open up any crack they find. Remedial treatment may be difficult if the situation has
gone out of hand.

:::

### OUTSIDE CHECKS

Take a critical look at your home from outside and in. Make use of a neighbour’s upper windows to help you see the roof. Use binoculars if you
can. The most serious damage could lead to collapse of all or part of the building, but anything which lets in rain or damp can start a chain of
problems. Paint and other decorative treatments have a vital function in protecting wood and other materials, and require regular upkeep.

#### Roof

No roof covering is expected to last forever. The effects of the weather and conditions inside the roof space will take their toll. Look for
sagging (drooping) roof lines. This may only indicate that, over a long period of settlement, the external walls have stood firm while the
internal structure has ‘sunk’ slightly. This may not be serious. However, timbers may be decaying because of inadequate weatherproofing,
condensation in the roof space or even infestation of wood-boring insects. Sometimes a new roof covering may be too heavy for the old timbers, or
new work—such as a loft window—may be inadequately braced.

From the outside, try to find a good vantage point such as a neighbour’s upper window—use binoculars from the ground. Look for
deformation of the shape and slipped tiles or slates. The latter may be due to failure of the nails holding them in place and could be
progressive.

From the inside, working with a good light (and strong boards across the joists when there is no attic flooring) look for damp and rot. Its
location may help pinpoint external problems. It may also be due to condensation in the roof space. All roofs are designed with some ventilation,
usually at the eaves, to allow the space to ‘breathe’.

Wood-boring insects can do very considerable damage if allowed to colonize the roof space. Badly-infected timbers may have to be cut out and
replaced. However serious the infestation, all internal timbers should be treated.

Lead roofs are vulnerable to the extremes of climate. Repeated expansion and contraction will crack the lead, resulting in further problems. Avoid
long runs of lead which accentuate the problem.

All flat roofs must have good drainage. Most felt roofs will blister and trap water, but more damage is done by walking on them, or resting
ladders on them, than is done by the weather. Cracked or leaky felt may only need to be painted with a new protective coating. Consult a local
supplier.

:::danger[Warning]

When insulating the loft space, do not carry the insulating material too far into the eaves. The loft needs to ‘breathe’ and you must
not cut off or restrict its air supply. To do so could result in a build-up of condensation, which could lead to rot. This problem is
particularly aggravated by ‘magic’ roof paints, used to seal and secure old slate roofs. This thick coating seals in the slates
(trapping moisture which was present at the time of application) and could lead to far more serious problems that those you were trying to
solve.

:::

#### Chimneys and flashings

Flashings round roof edges and the base of chimneys always cause problems, but chimneys are at risk from inside as well. The soot contains acids,
which eat away at the fabric of the stack. Pots on the top are set in mortar (known as flaunching). This may break up over the years, allowing
pots to fall. Chimney stacks have been known to fall, sometimes onto the roof and thereby down into the house. Check your chimneys!

#### Gutters and downpipes

Leaks are easiest to see when it’s raining-you may be able to use a hose to produce the same effect. Look for stains on the wall, algae
growing round brackets and joins. Plastic guttering is notorious for drooping or failing if the runs between retaining clips are too great.
Drooping can cause otherwise secure seals to fail. Cast iron and aluminium guttering are subject to rust and corrosion (respectively).

:::info[EFFECTS OF CLIMATE]

Pay particular attention to the sides of your house which face the prevailing wind or receive the severest ‘baking’ from the sun.
Heavy rain, driven by strong winds, will find its way into all sorts of cracks and crevices. Flashings may be lifted by particularly strong
gusts. Rain may be driven underneath roof coverings.

Strong sunlight gradually cooks paint and breaks it down. You will always have the worst problems with woodwork on the ‘sunny’ side of
the house. Black and dark paints suffer most, because they absorb the heat.

The weight of a heavy snow fall may be too great for weak roofs and gutters to bear. Freezing temperatures will freeze water which has
penetrated cracks and crevices, causing them to expand and let in more water. Remember, water bursts a frozen pipe indoors and can do the same
to blocked downpipes outside.

:::

Blockages, such as leaves, twigs and birds’ nests can cause water to sit in the gutters for long periods of time instead of racing away as is
intended. Settlement of the house may mean that gutters, originally sloping to allow water to escape, no longer do so.

Leaky overflows, if they have persisted for ‘a long time, will usually make a stain on the wall or the ground below. In winter a leaky
overflow may produce a deadly patch of ice. Check the tank!

#### Walls

Look for horizontal or vertical distorting, eroded mortar between brickwork, cracked rendering, missing tiles or other cladding, soil or other
obstructions covering the damp-proof course, blocked airbricks. Sulphates in some kinds of brick (and in chimney soot) can cause mortar, rendering
and concrete to expand and crack. Areas looking damp when the rest of the wall has dried may indicate where old bricks, which have become porous,
are located.

#### Doors and windows

Check for severe distortion and paint or varnish in bad condition (plastic frames and some metal frames may not need painting). Ferrous metals and
most woods must be protected from the weather. Look for gaps between frames and walls and cracked putty round windowpanes. Clear drip grooves
under sills, which are designed to allow water to drip harmlessly off the edge. When blocked or bridged, water will penetrate where the sill joins
the wall.

#### Woodwork

All external woodwork should be weatherproofed, usually with paint, varnish or preservative. Most problems are easy to spot. Bodged repairs never
last. It’s far better to get the job done properly. Check for wet rot—usually apparent from the ‘sponginess’ of the wood, which
may also break away very easily. This rot must be treated because it will spread or lead to dry rot—which is more serious
[see Rot](#rotinfestation)).

### INSIDE CHECKS

<span>Structural distortion</span>

Movement of the building may produce interior cracks in the plasterwork, distortion of door and window frames, slipped cracks in the corners of
rooms (most noticeable when wallpaper looks stretched or torn). If the structure is actually sound, remedial work is mostly cosmetic. In severe
cases, doors and windows will stick, glass in windows will break, and floors will slope. Changes in use of a building, heavy furniture or a whole
library of books in an upstairs room will take their toll. So will changes in climate, which cause the internal timbers to expand and contract.

#### Support walls

Home ‘improvers’ sometimes knock out a wall between two small rooms, to create a larger one. Careful checks must be made to see if you are
removing a support wall.

If the joists supporting the floor above (or in the loft space) run parallel to the wall, you are probably all right. However, if they run at
right angles to the wall—or travel at right angles over the wall—then you are going to have to insert a special reinforced steel
joist. In some cases a support pillar may be required to give extra strength.

When you consider that the load on this wall may include the support of a roof brace, it is easy to imagine what would happen if the wall was
removed!

Check thoroughly. A wall which is not load-bearing on the ground floor might be positioned to help carry one of the upper floors of the building.

### DAMP

Damp conditions can be disastrous to your health, and distressing to live with. There are three main problems:

#### Rising damp

Rising damp is caused by water soaking up from the ground into the walls. Most houses have a damp-proof course to prevent this, but this barrier
may be bridged on the outside (perhaps by a pile of earth), or on the inside (the plaster on the wall may have been taken down too far). In houses
with cavity walls, debris may have accumulated at the bottom of the cavity.

This problem must be checked very early on. Look for damp plaster and peeling wallpaper at or near floor level-although in severe cases there is
no limit to how high the damp will rise. Skirtings, floor joists and floorboards may be damp or even rotten.

#### Penetrating damp

Penetrating damp is more likely in older homes-or at least, buildings with solid walls. Cavity walls don’t tend to favour damp penetration,
unless the cavity has been bridged. A full check must be made outside to try to find the point of entry.

#### Condensation

Condensation-evident as water droplets on walls and ceilings, windows heavily laden with moisture, damp furnishings—is caused by warm,
moisture-laden air coming into contact with cold, uninsulated surfaces. It is aggravated by bad ventilation. In severe cases mould may form,
plaster walls may disintegrate, wood and furnishings may rot.

:::info[TEST FOR DAMPNESS]

A moisture meter, which you may be able to hire, will not only tell you if a surface is damp—it will also tell you where the greatest
concentration of moisture is located. This could be invaluable if you are having trouble locating the source of the damp. The meter has two
pins which penetrate the damp surface and produce a reading.

If you can’t decide whether a surface is damp or not—perhaps it is a cold external wall or a concrete floor—tape a sheet of
polythene on a selected area. If there is a lot of moisture present in that area, droplets will form on the underside of the polythene sheet.

:::

Raising the temperature in a room increases the capacity of the air to hold moisture without condensing. But it’s a major battle against cold
walls and windows which need insulating. Cold pipes should be generously lagged. In the desire to cut off draughts, there is the danger of sealing
all ventilation from a room [see Gas](#gas)).

Condensation also occurs when a chimney has been closed off or removed without the insertion of an airbrick, or in the roof when loft insulation
is carried too far into the breathing spaces round the eaves.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Just as we need fresh air to survive, good ventilation is vital to keep your home healthy. Airbricks—basically bricks with holes
in—are used to vent the spaces under floors or in sealed chimney stacks. These prevent the build-up of moisture-laden air. Don’t
block them!

In rooms with high levels of condensation, such as kitchens and bathrooms, extractor fans should be employed—either on an outside wall
or through a window. If neither is available it may be necessary to run ducting to a suitable escape point.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Don’t seal off every little draught from a room, particularly if it’s regularly occupied or contains a fuel-burning appliance.
Moisture build-up from human breath and burning fuel will produce condensation. Most fuel-burning appliances also produce moisture, along with
carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide which are highly poisonous, especially in concentration.

:::

### ROT/INFESTATION

All woodwork, especially softwoods (which comprise a large amount of the inner framework of most houses), should not be exposed to persistent wet
conditions, whatever the cause. The occasional spillage of water is harmless, but constant wetting will lay the way open for wet rot or dry rot.

#### Rot

Areas most likely to develop rot are roof timbers (either from damp penetration or condensation), bathrooms (round the bath, shower, toilet,
bidet), kitchens (round the sink), window frames, door frames, floors and skirtings (particularly in the presence of rising damp).

Dry rot is the more serious. It lives on timber, favouring damp unventilated spaces. Usually it goes undetected until it is well under way,
the first sign often being a floorboard beginning to weaken. It gives off a distinctive mushroomy smell which should be noticeable in severe
cases.

The wood darkens in colour and cracks across and along the grain, producing an uneven network of squares, often with grey furry patches of
mould. The wood becomes very light and crumbly. If the air is very moist round the fungus, it may produce larger fluffy whitish growths. After
a year or so it produces thick bracket-like fruiting bodies with rust-red spores clearly visible.

Dry rot is fast and deadly. It will travel across brickwork to reach unaffected timber. The spores travel well, and if they land on moist
timber the whole process is accelerated.

Wet rot needs damp wood to survive. The fungus usually only penetrates damp wood. It doesn’t spread in the same way—it’s
unlikely to produce fruiting bodies indoors.

It grows into the wet wood, softening it, and producing cracks along the grain. More than one fungus can produce wet rot, but the wood may
appear lighter in colour and very fibrous, sometimes with brown strands on the surface.

Wet rot tends to die if the wood dries out, but the path may be open for dry rot to develop.

Any case of rot must be treated as a top priority. Affected timbers may need to be cut out and replaced. At any rate, whatever the scale of
the emergency, expert help should be sought. All wood should be treated with chemicals to inhibit further mould growth, after all possible
sources of damp have been eliminated. Any wood being cut out and removed should be in sealed polythene bags and disposed of finally by
burning.

:::danger[Warning]

New timber used for skirting boards, window frames and door frames may be ‘green wood’. Traditionally timber was seasoned before
use-left for a couple of years to expand, contract or warp and adjust to atmospheric moisture. With increased demand, wood is sometimes
kiln-dried to speed up the process.

Much new wood may still be ‘green’, containing a substantial amount of water. It is quite common for such wood to rot, once
installed and painted.

:::

#### Wood-borers

Groups of small holes in timber, or small clouds of powdered wood falling from them, indicate the presence of wood-boring insects
([see here](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#wood-boring-insects)). In most cases, it is the larvae of various beetles which do the damage, tunnelling through the wood until they emerge as adult beetles.

The main culprits in temperate climates are woodworm (common furniture beetles), which favour the sapwood of softwoods-which comprise most of
the wooden structure of most houses-plus the sapwood of oak. They also have a taste for beech, birch, elm, mahogany and older-style plywood.

Small piles of wood dust round clean 1.5-2mm (1/6in) holes indicate recent activity. These are the flight holes from which the adult beetles
emerge after the larvae have eaten their way around the inside of the timber for about three years. The best time to treat woodworm is in the
spring, before the warm weather arrives and the beetles emerge. The pupae are usually just below the surface.

Deathwatch beetles prefer partly decayed oak and are usually found in older buildings, producing more damage and 3mm (1/8in) flight holes.
They are quite rare.

House longhorn beetles are also quite rare, but represent a very large family of beetles around the world-many of which can do considerable
damage. The flight holes are oval, usually about 10 x 6mm (3/8 x 1/4in), filled with bore dust. House longhorns tend to attack the sapwood of
seasoned softwoods. The larval stage can last eleven years, so by the time the flight holes appear, timbers may be ‘eaten away’
inside.

Powder post beetles tend to inhabit timber yards and sawmills, favouring the sapwood of new hardwoods. They don’t like old wood. Their
flight holes are about 1.5mm (1/16in) across.

Wood-boring weevils tend to prefer decaying hard or soft wood-they are most commonly found in damp cellars and buildings close to water. Once
the rot is treated the weevils tend to die out.

In sub-tropical and tropical climates, termites are a major problem. They look like large white ants—and are often so called. They
attack almost anything that contains cellulose-wood, paper, cardboard, chipboard. They don’t live in wood— they eat it or take it
back to their nest, which may be underground. Attack by termites should be treated as an emergency. Chemical and biological controls are used,
but termites are very determined.

It’s common to try sheet metal at ground level to protect posts and structural timbers—but even sheet metal damp-courses don’t
stop them. They can create a route through most thin substances, including metal, glass and concrete. They may even attack the sheathing of
cables, causing short circuits and power failures, and make holes in piping.

The lead cable borer in the US favours hardwoods like oak and laurel-also called ‘short circuit’, it bores into lead-lined cables. The
bamboo borer, although it only breeds in tropical climates, may be exported to any location in bamboo furniture. It may attack wood in the
home—not just bamboo-if conditions are favourable.

Carpenter ants (mainly in the US) create galleries inside timbers, depositing excavated wood outside their nests. Carpenter bees bore 20mm
(3/4in) diameter holes, which lead to large galleries which run with the grain of the wood.

#### Avoiding infestation

Woodworm, in particular, like old furniture—the thin plywood backs of wardrobes, all-plywood ‘utility’ furniture and basket
work. Treat any second hand or imported furniture before installing it in your home as a matter of course. Treat all timbers if there has been
any evidence of attack. Treat all new wood that is brought into the house. Don’t store lots of old furniture or wood in the loft.

:::info[WOOD PRESERVATIVES/INSECTICIDES]

Protective clothing (including boots, gloves, filter mask and goggles) MUST be worn when applying fungicides, insecticides. They-and
preservatives. They—and the fumes given off by them—are toxic for up to a week after application. During this period:

-   Do NOT smoke or use naked flames near chemicals or treated areas— keep a fire extinguisher nearby
-   Turn off gas pilot lights in treated areas
-   Turn off electricity or isolate circuits in the area by removing fuses for at least 48 hours
-   Temporarily remove loft insulation and securely cover water tanks for at least two weeks, if treatment is in loft
-   Protect any rubber cables close to timber to be treated with sealer (shellac)—or cover with polythene sheet
-   If spraying, use a coarse spray, rather than a fine mist
-   Keep area well ventilated
-   Do NOT sleep in a treated area and try to avoid any use for at least a week after application—longer if possible
-   Do not eat, drink or smoke during treatment
-   Take a shower or bath immediately after finishing the work

[See DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS: Protective clothing](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards#protective-clothing)

:::

The main object of treatment is to safeguard the main structural timbers of the house—the roof timbers and floor joists. Treatment is a
hazardous process. Don’t hesitate to contact experts to deal with large infestations.

Rotting wood—fences, outbuildings and piles of timber-may harbour any number of wood pests. Some pests don’t travel very
far—others will seek out certain timbers. DON’T allow a large amount of wood to rot near your house—even fungal spores may
spread.

Shipping furniture around the world seems a very likely way of introducing new pests to a country. This has already happened with several of
the species listed.

Termites (in sub-tropical and tropical climates) may initially make their presence known in fences and outbuildings. DON’T wait for them
to discover your house. If you see evidence of attack, or large ‘white ants’, the time has come to act.

### ASBESTOS

Asbestos is now considered a dangerous mineral. Inhalation of the tiny fibres (thousands would fit into a millimetre cube) may eventually lead
to:

Asbestosis: a scarring of the lung tissue, leading to restricted breathing and sometimes death.

Mesothelioma: a form of cancer affecting the lining of the abdomen or chest. It is usually fatal and has been linked to exposure to asbestos
dust.

Lung cancer: although smoking is considered the primary cause of lung cancer, reports suggest that exposure to asbestos increases the risk
considerably.

:::tip[Remember]

Not even a small piece of asbestos, such as a simmering mat for a stove, should be thrown into the wastebin. Waste disposal carts often
crunch up rubbish and this would release fibres into the air. Dampen asbestos and double-wrap in polythene bags. Consult local government
health departments for instructions on safe disposal locally.

:::

#### Types of asbestos

Most old asbestos looks greyish in colour, but in fact there are three main types: brown, blue and white—white being the most common.
Blue and brown have most often been linked with illness and are seldom used now. To be on the safe side, treat ALL forms as extremely
dangerous, with NO ‘safe’ level for exposure to dust and fibres.

#### Common uses for asbestos

-   Oven gloves
-   Old fire blankets, fire gloves
-   Toasters, hairdryers, irons
-   Tumbledryers
-   Insulation round hot water pipes
-   Ironing board iron rests
-   Door seals round ovens
-   Wall cladding
-   Roofing
-   Guttering, downpipes, flues
-   Simmering pads
-   Car brake linings and underseals
-   Fire doors
-   Old electrical storage heaters
-   Old textured wall and ceiling coatings
-   Ceiling tiles
-   Flooring

#### What to do

Sheet asbestos in good condition under layers of paint is best left where it is. Asbestos is at its most dangerous when friable (flaky and
crumbly)—as is often the case with oven door seals and pipe insulation. NEVER drill, saw, sand or scrub asbestos. ALWAYS keep an eye
open for signs of wear and tear. You should NEVER attempt large-scale removal yourself. Call an expert for advice.

:::info[IF YOU MUST TACKLE SMALL-SCALE REMOVAL]

-   Keep other people away
-   Wear disposable mask, overalls (preferably disposable), rubber or washable boots and disposable gloves
-   Wet asbestos
-   Do NOT use power tools—cut slowly by hand
-   Remove as large pieces as possible—the less it breaks up the better
-   Put all pieces in at least two heavy-duty plastic bags and mark clearly: DANGER! ASBESTOS DUST! DO NOT INHALE!
-   Clean up with a damp cloth and put cloth and disposable clothing in same bag before closing
-   Wash non-disposable clothing
-   Shower, washing all over including your hair

:::

### PUTTING THINGS RIGHT

House repairs take time and money, quite apart from the upheaval and stress that may be caused. Try to think, during every day of major work,
that-if done properly—many jobs may not need doing again in your lifetime. Bodged repairs will only lead to more work, more stress and
more expenditure.

Outdoor maintenance may not seem as rewarding as tackling interior decoration—but it is much more important. You may find yourself
redecorating very soon if you haven’t had a proper job done on a leaky roof, or had rotten wood removed and made good.

#### Priorities

Give priority to making the house watertight—bad weather may force this decision upon you. Whatever the weather, treat the following as
urgent:

-   Serious cracks in walls, rendering
-   Defects in the roof
-   Rising damp, wet rot, dry rot
-   Problems with gutters, downpipes or external drainage
-   Unsafe chimney stacks Inside: Do something about:
-   Faulty or inadequate electrical systems
-   Leaky, bodged plumbing and heating systems
-   Inadequate lighting on stairs and changes of floor level
-   Ventilation
-   Blocked or damaged chimneys and flues

#### Annual inspections

Once a year, or immediately after a bad storm or very high winds, check the condition of the roof. Look for loose tiles and slates, displaced
flashings where roofs abut a wall or round the base of the chimney, blocked gutters and downpipes, signs of water penetration through walls and
ceilings, deteriorating external woodwork, blocked airbricks.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

When large-scale remedial work is undertaken it may be your chance to make major improvements to your home. Bear in mind that you are likely
to need planning permission for certain types of building work.

:::

:::tip[BASIC SERVICES]

Every house is different, as is every lifestyle, but most homes rely on water supplies, electricity, gas, oil, or solid fuels. Remember it is
your home and you are in control. All the basic services, while making life easier or more comfortable, can also be sources of great danger.

You SHOULD know where to go in your home to turn off any or all of the supplies—both for routine maintenance and in the case of
emergency. DON’T wait until the storage tank in the loft overflows and brings down a ceiling. DON’T allow someone to be asphyxiated by
gas before checking that a gas appliance is correctly installed.

It is NOT enough to know where the levers or stopcocks are. Check that you can operate them and that they do the job they are supposed to do.
It is not impossible that someone has, at some time, bypassed a meter or rerouted a supply for convenience. The stopcock on the water inlet
may NOT completely turn off all the water in the house. CHECK! When you switch off the electricity, is ALL the power off?

If you are in any doubt about the efficiency of the controls, or if they are very hard to get at, get them sorted out.

In a multi-occupied dwelling, some of the shared services may have only one turn-off point. Is it accessible to you at any time—day or
night? If not, consider having your own controls installed. This is obviously vital in the case of gas or electricity.

## **ELECTRICITY**

Most of us take electricity completely for granted. We flip a switch and a light comes on. We want toast, and pop the bread in the toaster. We
want food quickly and microwave ovens offer just that. There is an electrical gadget for every job, and the demand on domestic supplies is
enormous.

In most houses, particularly older ones, the supply is barely up to the demand. More and more sockets are added—or worse, people start
overloading sockets and adding make-do extension leads.

There are two hazards which must always be remembered when dealing with electricity—FIRE and ELECTROCUTION. Almost half of all domestic
fires, some causing loss of life, are caused by electrical faults. Electrocution is less common, but still claims hundreds of lives every year.

Most common-sense precautions will protect you from both hazards. Because electricity is so dangerous, it is well worth understanding as much
about it as possible.

### INTRODUCTION

Electricity existed in nature before man ever thought of generating it himself and using it to his advantage. Lightning is probably the most
violent and dangerous manifestation-although simple ‘static’ produced when combing your hair or the charge built up in garments during
tumbledrying is also electricity. Most of us have walked across a man-made-fibre carpet and then touched something, only to receive a jolt of pain
in the fingertips. This is a minor electric shock.

Even the human body is operated by tiny electrical impulses sent through the brain, nerves and muscles. This is partly why electrocution is so
serious.

Man-made electricity is only useful to us when it is channelled through an appliance. When current flows through a lightbulb, the filament glows.
When connected to an electric motor, the motor turns. In all appliances heat is generated-and a magnetic field. The heat may be a problem,
although adequate ventilation and careful use of appliances should take care of this. Sometimes the heat generated is the whole point-as in an
electric fire.

The magnetic field is usually too small to matter, unless you live in close proximity to a group of pylons or a generating station, when the
powerful magnetic field may have a damaging effect on your health.

#### The circuit

Think of electricity as energy being pushed under pressure along a wire. The electric current flows because the pressure is greater on the side it
enters an appliance—the live wire—than on the side where it leaves the appliance—the neutral wire.

The electric current moves in a circuit. If that circuit is broken, it cannot flow. By switching off a switch or unplugging an appliance, you are
breaking the circuit.

The supply of electricity you receive flows from the incoming mains, through your meter and fuse box/consumer unit, along the fixed cables which
are (usually) hidden in the walls, ceiling and floors. Via socket and plug or lampholder, the current flows through the live wire to the
appliance, causes the appliance to do whatever it does, and then returns to the mains supply again down the neutral wire.

:::danger[]

The live wire—in some countries—is known as the active, positive or hot wire. The earth—especially in the US—is called
the ground.

:::

#### Conductors/insulators

The current flows through some substances more easily than through others. Substances which allow electricity to flow are called conductors. Most
metals are conductors—copper, brass and aluminium are commonly used for wiring.

Substances which resist or prohibit the flow of electricity are called insulators. Most non-metals fall into this category-but in practice the
most common insulators are plastics, rubber and ceramic.

For these reasons most domestic wiring is copper, which is a good conductor and flexible enough to work with. It is sheathed in waterproof plastic
to restrict the flow of electricity to the copper.

#### Test of strength

Conductors have to be thick enough to take the amount of current passing through them. Generally, the stronger the current, the thicker the
conductor has to be. The longer the run of cable, the thicker too. DON’T expect a thin cable used for wiring a battery-operated doorbell to
carry a full-strength mains current. The wire will heat up, melting the insulating plastic coating and then melting itself at the weakest
point-possibly starting a fire in the process!

Trying to pass a heavy current in this way is causing the wire to act like a fuse ([see Fuses](#fuses)). It is also the principle of
the light bulb—but the filament does not burn out because air, which is needed for combustion, is excluded from the bulb.

#### High voltages

Very high voltages carried in overhead cables are insulated by the air. Ceramic insulators are used to protect the pylons and the points at which
the current comes down to earth. The currents carried may be as high as 400,000 volts, and are reduced at substations to be used domestically.

:::danger[Warning]

Although air is a good insulator, very high voltages can ‘arc’ across quite a gap (up to l8m/60ft). Never fool around near overhead
cables with a kite or a carbon-fibre fishing rod. You could quite easily bring the power down into your body and kill yourself.

:::

#### Earthing/grounding

Electricity always wants to return to earth. This process of ‘earthing’ is what happens when you receive an electric shock from an
appliance, or from a live wire. The electricity is trying to return to earth through you. The human body is not a very good conductor, but so
strong is the tendency for electricity to earth itself, it will take any route offered to it. Effectively, you form a circuit.

Wearing rubber boots, which cut off the route to earth and therefore break the circuit, should protect you. Standing on wet ground makes you a
more efficient circuit and is therefore deadly.

For this reason, mains circuits and most appliances carry a third wire (apart from the live and the neutral)—the earth wire. In appliances,
particularly those with metal casings, the earth wire will be fixed to the inside of the casing. It is intended to offer a swifter route to earth
for the electricity than you do-thereby protecting you. In reality, it does more to protect the appliance—the fuse does more to protect you
([see Fuses](#fuses)).

:::tip[REMEMBER]

The earthing of your domestic wiring is designed to save your life and prevent fires. Do NOT tamper with it or disconnect it. It is advisable
to have your earth checked every few years or after work has been done on your wiring.

:::

The electricity should pass down the earth wire to the socket. The socket is connected to the mains supply, which is also earthed. All the earth
wires on the domestic circuit should run to one heavy earth cable at the meter. It used to be quite common for the mains supply’s earth to be
connected to the water pipes to guarantee a quick and easy journey for the electricity, but the introduction of plastic plumbing has rendered this
method unreliable. You will still find that water and gas pipes are earthed to protect anyone touching part of these systems should any part of
the electrical wiring come into contact with either of them.

:::danger[Warning]

Plastic plumbing is becoming more common. This is not effective as a means of earthing your domestic electricity. If all or even part of your
plumbing has been replaced with plastic, your mains supply may no longer be earthed. CHECK!

:::

### ELECTROCUTION

It is VITAL to understand electrocution, and what to do if it occurs. Through touching an appliance which has become ‘live’ or by touching
a live wire, the current is carried through the body. Since many materials, including water and even urine, are effective conductors, it is
possible to receive a shock without realizing that you are in any immediate danger.

It is quite safe to touch properly-insulated wiring in dry conditions, but use electrical screwdrivers with properly-insulated handles and stand
on non-conductive surfaces—a rubber mat will do, or thick rubber boots. Do NOT touch or lean on pipes or scaffolding as there is a
possibility that these could give the current an earth again.

A shock is very painful and frightening. The effects and seriousness depend on the circumstances and the individual. If the body is wet, or in wet
conditions, a shock is more likely to be fatal. Most fatal shocks at domestic voltage happen when the current passes from one hand to the
other—and therefore through the heart. Expect any of the following:

-   Muscle spasms which cause the victim to grip the source of current. You must NOT touch the victim or the source of the current-you will also
    receive a shock. You MUST sever the contact with a non-conductors—a leather belt, a stick, a piece of furniture, a piece of clothing
    (avoiding body contact)
-   The person may have fallen and hurt themselves, or may fall when the current is broken
-   The heart may have stopped beating
-   Breathing may have stopped
-   Severe muscle spasms have been known to break bones
-   There may be severe burns
-   The victim may be unconscious or even ‘dead’ (but revivable with urgent medical attention)

:::danger[Warning]

If someone is electrocuted by extremely high voltages from overhead cables, do not even get close to them. If you attempt to sever the contact
with a ‘non-conductor’ such as a stick or a piece of clothing, the current will ‘jump’ the gap. Call for help.

:::

:::warning[SAVE A LIFE!]
ELECTROCUTION

<div class="text-center">
![ ](/images/img028_002.jpg)
</div>

You must act quickly. If someone else is with you, they should call an ambulance while you apply first aid

-   CHECK! Is current still flowing? DON’T touch victim or source of current
-   CHECK! Is there water about? You may be at risk
-   SWITCH OFF at consumer unit or socket

OR

-   Pull victim free with leather belt, dry towel, stick
-   Knock victim’s hand free with a stick IF victim is dry, grasp clothing WITHOUT touching body

If victim has fallen there may be other injuries—don’t move the person unless you have to

IS VICTIM BREATHING? IS HEART BEATING?

If not breathing: Give artificial respiration—either [mouth-to-mouth](/sas-urban/urban-health#mouth-to-mouth) or mouth-to-nose.
DON’T GIVE UP?

If heart not beating: Check for pulse. Victim may look ‘blue’, especially round lips. Give
[cardiac compression](/sas-urban/urban-health#cardiac-compression).

If not breathing AND heart not beating: Give six compressions alternated with two lung inflations.
If you have help: One person concentrates on breathing, the other on the heart.

WHEN BREATHING AND HEARTBEAT ARE OK  
Place victim in [recovery position](/sas-urban/urban-health#recovery-position).

BURNS  
As soon as possible-at once, if there is more than one first-aider, reduce the temperature of the burns with cold water/ice. If working alone,
attend to the heart and breathing first.

:::

#### Don’t take chances

If someone has received a shock, especially if they have lost consciousness as a result, they should have an immediate medical check-up. Even if
the victim appears well, they should be kept warm and quiet until the effects of the shock have definitely passed.

Burns, even when the shock does not appear to have other adverse effects, may be quite deep. Reduce the temperature as quickly as possible. Seek
medical attention.

:::danger[Warning]

If you attempt to work on any part of a domestic circuit, then the whole circuit must be rendered harmless at the consumer unit. If you have a
fuse box, take the fuse out and keep it in your pocket. That way you definitely KNOW no one will switch the current back on while you are
working. DON’T play games with electricity. DON’T take chances with electricity. DON’T GUESS. If a problem develops, go to the
meter/consumer unit/fuse box and turn off the supply.

:::

#### No earth wire?

Not every appliance has an earth wire. You can see from the flex (especially when connecting a plug) if there is only a live and a neutral wire.

Older lighting circuits were rarely earthed. This was because it was considered unlikely that people would regularly touch ceiling fittings.

Some appliances have plastic casings which cannot become live, or may claim to be ‘double insulated’. Such appliances rarely have an earth
wire.

With appliances which have no earth wire, or which claim to be ‘double insulated’, make very sure you use the recommended fuse, both in
the plug for the appliance and at the fuse box/consumer unit by the meter.

:::danger[Warning]

On domestic lighting circuits which do not include an earth wire, be very careful when using metal light fittings. If a fault develops, you
are NOT protected. Always turn off the switch when changing the bulb. Put a piece of tape over the switch to avoid someone else turning on the
light from habit when entering the room. To be completely safe, turn off the power at the fuse box/consumer unit (or remove the fuse until you
have changed the bulb).

:::

:::info[NON-EARTHED SYSTEMS]

Remote areas may receive mains power on a non-earthing system, whereby current trying to run to earth is fed back into the mains along the
neutral wire. These systems are rare and are governed by strict regulations. Do NOT attempt to make changes to the system yourself, unless you
are a qualified electrician. This system is sometimes known as a protective multiple earth.

:::

### WHAT THE TERMS MEAN

Current is the rate of flow of electricity, and is measured in amperes, known as amps (usually seen as A).
Voltage is the pressure difference between the live and neutral wires (usually expressed as volts or V).

The resistance of an appliance to the flow of electricity, or the amount it impedes the flow (impedance), is measured in ohms (usually &Omega;).

Watts (W) are used to measure the power consumption of an appliance. Actually the number of watts indicates the amount of electrical energy the
appliance consumes in a set period of time. This sounds complicated, until you remember that a 15W lamp is pretty much at the lower end of the
scale. It doesn’t get very hot or glow very brightly. A 100W lamp gives out a lot of light and heat, using more electrical energy. An electric
fire with one straight radiant element is likely to be 1000W (1kW). Most of the electrical energy is turned into considerable heat to make the
fire effective.

#### Simple maths

You may be unsure about the power rating of an appliance, but in practice most electrical equipment is well-labelled to tell you the voltage,
impedance or power consumption. Often the instruction booklet gives you more information.

If you know two of the values, it is possible to calculate the third:
W = V x A indicates the consumption of power
A = W &divide; V indicates a safe fuse or flex rating

#### AC/DC

When voltage is expressed on an appliance as, say, 240V, it’s quite usual to see the letters AC immediately following. This refers to the type
of supply.

Electricity is produced by a conductor (usually a coil of copper) rotating in a magnetic field. This process produces what appears to be a steady
current, but one half of each revolution produces a positive charge, the other results in a negative charge. The current alternates between
positive/negative at approximately 50 times a second, in Britain. This is called alternating current-AC.

Direct current (DC) does not alternate positive/negative-and is usually achieved by electronically rectifying the alternating current. In some
situations a DC current is necessary-usually in industry. DC current is often used for controlling motors, lifts, trains and underground trains.
Many motorized household appliances convert AC to DC—including turntables, some food mixers and some fans.

### DOMESTIC SUPPLIES

Electricity for domestic use is not supplied at the same voltage throughout the world. This doesn’t really matter unless you intend to travel
with electrical equipment. There may even be regional variations within a country. There are adaptors and transformers available to enable
electrical equipment to be used safely. These step up or decrease the voltage accordingly. You should find out in advance if this is likely to be
a problem- KNOW YOUR DESTINATION!

:::danger[Warning]

If an appliance designed for a higher voltage is plugged into a lower power supply, it probably won’t work-or will operate at reduced
speed and efficiency. Plugging in an appliance into too high a power supply may result in overheating, fire or explosion DON’T GUESS!

:::

#### Major differences

Power supplies, electrical sockets and plugs vary the world over. In the UK and Australia, for example, voltages are very similar and both use
three-pin plugs. The important difference is that plugs are not fused in Australia—whereas they always are in the UK. In the US, not
only is the voltage lower, but plugs are two-pin and unfused. Switches on lamps may be turn buttons, not rocker switches or press buttons.
Room switches may operate in the opposite direction to the UK. ‘Up’ may be ON, while ‘down’ is OFF. All could lead to
confusion and mistakes could be dangerous.

If travelling or emigrating, be aware of national variations. KNOW YOUR DESTINATION!

#### Types of domestic circuit

The electricity supply enters a premises through a sealed service fuse box (to which only the electricity company has access), passes through
the meter (which records the current used) and travels through a set of fuses, before being distributed about the building.

Very old systems had separate fuses for each outlet. Power (socket) and lighting circuits, even quite recently, had separate fuse boxes. A
messy fuse board may indicate old, messy or dangerous wiring.

A modern system usually has a single fuse box, or consumer unit, linked to a smaller number of circuits, with each circuit protected by a fuse
or circuit-breaker. Each appliance is protected by a fuse in its plug. Alternatively the actual socket (or special switch) may also be fused.

Heavy cable is used to serve a number of outlets, which are usually arranged as a ring—starting and ending at the consumer unit. This is
known as a ring main.

A less-common domestic arrangement—a radial circuit-passes the current from one outlet to another, but ends at the last outlet.
Spurs or extensions may have been taken off either of these types of circuit at any point, to serve another outlet.

Special circuits may be run off to serve rooms such as kitchens, where demand for power is high, or for individual appliances such as cookers.
It is unlikely that you will overload a circuit, unless you use a lot of demanding equipment such as electrical heaters.

#### Power limits

A 13-amp socket will be able to supply up to, but not more than, 3000 watts power if safely and correctly installed. Most ring mains carry a
fuse of 30 amps. This should tolerate a total load of 7200 watts—on the whole circuit.

The following box should help you work out if you are within safe limits:

:::info[POWER CONSUMPTION]

Here are some approximate ratings for different types of appliance. The information is designed to be for rough guidance only. Most
appliances will have information/specific ratings marked on them. CHECK!

-   Low-rated appliances—5 to 50 watts  
    Bedside clocks, clock radios, answering machines, electric razors, personal computers
-   Up to 125 watts  
    Televisions, fridges, hi-fi equipment, video recorders, low-rated food mixers,(most) plug-in lamps
-   200 to 350 watts  
    Medium-rated food mixers, do-it-yourself equipment such as circular saws and jigsaws, low-rated electric drills, sanders, very
    low-rated lawnmowers, freezers, very low-rated vacuum cleaners, low-rated hairdryers
-   Up to 1250 watts  
    More-powerful food mixers, vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers, hairdryers and electric drills, plus microwave ovens, coffee makers, irons,
    low-rated toasters, low-rated electric heaters
-   Up to 2500 watts  
    More-powerful electric heaters, fan heaters, tumbledryers, washing machines, low-rated ovens, low-rated kettles
-   Over 2500 watts  
    Powerful electric heaters and fan heaters, ovens, powerful kettles

:::

:::danger[]
Even from this list you can see that a 13-amp socket could not be used with an adaptor to take a 3000-watt kettle with ANY other
appliance. The socket would be overloaded.
:::

:::info[THREE-PHASE POWER]

With apparatus, or even an entire installation, that creates a very heavy demand for electricity, three-phase power is commonly used.
Generally speaking, this makes available three times the 240 volt (AC) supply. The three phases are balanced so that they are used
equally, and in most cases separately fused and arranged so that the alternations of each supply are ‘out of sync’ with one
another.

The commonest uses of three-phase power are kilns, hoists (reversible motors), factories, photographic/film studios, workshops, schools,
hospitals and other large buildings with a high number of rooms, sockets and lights.

ADDED DANGER

Three-phase equipment should be regularly checked for safety. In large buildings it should be arranged so that you can never come into
contact with more than one phase at a time. To do so could result in a shock of 415 volts. Usually three phases are each assigned
different tasks—NOT one phase to sockets, one to lights etc—so the risk of making contact with more than one phase is
eliminated. In most cases the three phases each feed an equal number of rooms.

NO NEUTRAL WIRE?

Three-phase motors usually have no neutral wire. The motor is fed by all three phases, and the consumption is balanced so that there is no
power to be returned via a neutral wire.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Never attempt any work on a three-phase circuit, unless qualified to do so. You would be risking a shock of 415 volts.

:::

### FUSES

When a wire carries a current, heat is generated. If the current is high and the wire is too thin to cope with it, the wire will get
hot—and probably ‘burn out’ or melt. A fuse is a deliberate ‘weak link’. If the current rises (usually because a fault
has developed) above the intended limit for a fuse, the fuse wire gets very hot, melts and breaks the circuit. This may be caused by:

-   Electricity leaking to earth, either directly, or through the earth wire. The earthed metal casing of an appliance may have become live
    and the current is returning to earth. This causes an increase in the current because there’s no resistance. The live and earth wires
    may have touched in a faulty plug or socket. Spilled water or another conductor may have formed a new connection.

-   Similarly, live and neutral wires may have become connected either directly or through a fault in an appliance.
-   Too heavy a load may have been placed on a circuit-perhaps too many high-powered appliances have been connected to it. The fuse won’t
    allow the circuit to be endangered by too much current passing through it.

:::info[REPLACING A FUSE]

Loosen screws. Remove old wire. Fix new wire at one end (A) with screw. Take wire across, tighten second screw (B). SNIP OFF SPARE WIRE!

:::

:::danger[Warning]

When a fault develops and a fuse ‘blows’, a dangerous amount of heat may have been generated in an appliance, a plug or a socket.
Check the circuit for signs of overheating.

:::

#### When a fuse ‘blows’

First check the fuse in the plug or socket. The easiest way to check them is to replace them, since a ‘blown’ fuse may not look any
different from a good one.

If these are working, go to the fuse box/consumer unit and check the fuse there or press the reset button ([see Replacing a fuse](#replacing-a-fuse)).

It’s usually more obvious when a fuse has blown at the fuse box (if you know which outlets are on a circuit) because a whole circuit will
be rendered inoperative. If a light on one floor’s lighting circuit blows a fuse, then all the other lights on that circuit will go out.

#### Replacing a fuse

If you know that switching on a light or a particular piece of equipment has blown a fuse, switch it off before attempting to replace the
fuse. If a circuit fuse has blown, test something else in the socket to make sure that the fault is not in the circuit. Check for possible
obvious causes before retrying the equipment or you will just keep blowing fuses.

An expansion fuse or ‘circuit breaker’ is enclosed and usually all you have to do to re-establish the circuit is to press the reset
control button or flip a switch (E). You will often find circuit breakers on sink disposal units and other equipment which is designed for
short spells of usage and can get overheated if run for too long (or are prone to jamming).

Cartridge fuses (D), which you will find inside plugs and special sockets as well as in fuse boxes, are sealed capsules containing a fuse
wire. A few are transparent and enable you to see the fuse, but most give no visible sign that they have blown.

You must simply replace the fuse and if the appliance works you will know that the fuse was the problem. You can always test an appliance fuse
by fitting it into the plug of equipment which you know is still operational.

Old style fuses in a fuse box each consist of a short piece of wire between two screws or terminals, passing over or through an insulated pad.
You will sometimes see that the middle of the wire has melted. If it looks complete, try lifting it with your screwdriver. Replace by fitting
another piece of fuse wire of correct value between screws or terminals (A, B and C).

:::danger[Warning]

Always use the correct value of fuse in a plug for an appliance, or at the main fuse box. Don’t simply copy the fuse you found there.
It may not have been the correct fuse.

:::

#### Fuse ratings for appliances

Using the correct fuse is VITAL. The lower-rated fuses, such as 3-amp, are used in the plugs of appliances with low power consumption. They
are intended to ‘blow’ more easily, protecting delicate equipment. Using a fuse of a higher rating may allow a fault to cause
overheating, possibly starting a fire.

On a 240 volt supply, 3-amp fuses are used for appliances up to 750 watts—this includes computers, televisions, clock radios and
fridges.

5-amp fuse is suitable for appliances which consume 760-1000 watts. A 10-amp fuse suits appliances 1000-2000 watts. Above this and up to 3000
watts maximum, a 13-amp fuse is safe.

:::info[RCDs/RCBs/ELCBs]

Residual current devices (also called residual current breakers and earth leakage circuit breakers) come in various forms. Some plug into
a socket, and the appliance is then plugged into them; some may be fitted into an extension cable; some replace sockets altogether; or
they may be part of the consumer unit. If anything goes wrong with the current, such as a sudden leak to earth (which might be you getting
a severe shock!), they instantly cut the power and need to be reset. They are very responsive and are designed to give you protection, in
addition to that given by fuses and earthing. ELCBs were so called because they respond to even small leakage of current to earth—a
leakage which might not blow a fuse.

RCDs are VITAL life insurance. Users of power tools, electrical gardening equipment or kitchen gadgets where liquid is involved should
ALWAYS use RCDs. If upgrading your domestic wiring, consider installing these safety devices on the whole system.

:::

Any electrical dealer or electrician will be able to advise you on the correct fuse ratings. Often the appliance is labelled, or the
instruction manual will indicate the amount of power consumed by the appliance. (For a general guide only, see Power consumption.)

#### Main circuit fuses

On a 240-volt supply, and especially on special circuits for cookers, showers and storage heaters, the correct fuses MUST be used. In general,
these are:

Immersion water heater: 15-20 amp
Lighting circuits: 5 amp
Ring power (socket) circuits: 30 amp
Radial power (socket) circuits: 20-30 amp
Showers: 30 amp
Oven (up to 12kW): 30 amp
Oven (over 12kW): 45 amp
Storage heaters: 20 amp
:::tip[REMEMBER]

Always keep a flashlight near your electricity meter. If it is in a dark cupboard, this will help you see what you’re doing. If you
need to switch off the power at night, you will need to avoid fumbling around. DON’T use a candle if the fuse box/consumer unit is
near your gas meter!

:::

### CABLES/FLEXES

Live, neutral and earth wires are colour-coded for identification to make sure that the correct electrical connections are made.
Unfortunately, colour coding is not standard around the world, but it is beginning to be. This can never take account of strange
‘bodged’ wiring jobs people may have created.

#### Main circuit wiring (cable)

Old rubber sheathing is still common and should be treated with suspicion. Rubber degrades with age and crumbles. But even modern wiring
(on supply cables) will have a red live, a black neutral and a green-and-yellow earth. In practice, the earth wire is often unsheathed in
the centre of the cable. Special green-and-yellow sheathing is sold for you to cut to length, to sleeve sections of the earth which are
exposed when making connections. DON’T use spare pieces of black or red sheathing. DON’T use electrical insulating tape.

#### Appliance wiring (flex)

The live is always brown, the neutral is always blue, the earth is always green-and-yellow (when there is an earth wire).

Old appliances—which should really be rewired and updated by an expert (or discarded)—will probably have a red live, a black
neutral and a green earth. If the wires are old, the colours of the sheathing may have faded or discoloured. DO NOT GUESS! Old rubber
insulation is, by now, not safe.

:::danger[Warning]

When connecting wiring with screw fittings, DON’T over tighten the screws. To do so may sever individual strands of multi-stranded
flex. These may become dislodged and form an unwanted and dangerous connection. With cable or single-stranded flex, over tightening
the screw may flatten (or even sever) the wire. Heavily-flattened wire may act like a fuse, with a reduced capacity for carrying
current. It can overheat, may burn out and may start a fire.

:::

#### Types of domestic cable

On a 240-volt supply, the lighting circuits are generally formed by 1.0mm<sup>2</sup> twin-and-earth (a plastic casing housing three
single-strand wires—one sheathed red, one black and one unsheathed. Each wire is about 1mm in diameter.

The power cable for the main power (socket) circuits is very similar, but of a heavier weight.
On special circuits for ovens, electrical heating installations or shower heaters, even thicker cables may be used.
:::danger[Warning]

No mains wiring alterations or installations should be attempted by anyone who is not qualified to do so. Because of the dangers in
some countries such as Australia, severe restrictions are imposed on the type of electrical work that you can do yourself.

:::

#### Types of flex

Flexes may contain two sheathed wires-brown (live) and blue (neutral)-in an outer casing OR three wires, if a yellow-and-green earth wire
is included. Sometimes a thin two-core flex may have no outer casing—but this is only really suitable for wiring battery-operated
doorbells.

Most flexes, inside the internal coloured sheathing, are made up of several thin strands of wire, which gives the flexibility. When
stripping the sheathing from the ends, for wiring a plug, take care not to sever individual strands. Losing one or two may not matter, but
if you lose too many the current bearing capacity of the wire is reduced at that point. This could cause overheating-or even fire.

When you buy flex, ask the dealer which is the correct one for a particular appliance. There is a rising scale of thickness to cope with
different power consumptions. The flex is usually marked with its recommended maximum load.

When using longer flexes-perhaps an extension lead to a garden tool—you will need a thicker cable to cope with the voltage drop over
the distance.

If the flex needs to withstand a lot of movement and handling (an iron, a power tool, a hairdryer), a heavier flex should be used than is
suggested by the power consumption.

For pendant light fittings, the flex needs to be heavy enough to support the lampshade, even if only a 25-watt lamp is used. NEVER expect
a heavy pendant fitting to be carried by the flex alone. A chain, or similar, must be anchored into a joist above the ceiling. The flex is
for carrying power-not weight.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Always use the flex grips on plugs to hold the flex. Make sure ALL the flex, including the outer sheath, is held. NEVER pull plugs out
of their sockets by the flex.

:::

:::info[MISWIRING A PLUG]

DANGER! Miswiring a plug, by swapping the live and neutral wires, is extremely dangerous. The fuse in the plug is totally ineffective,
because the live wire is not connected to it.

Normally, what happens when a table lamp (for instance) is switched off, is that the switch breaks the circuit—stopping the live
current at the switch. When the live and neutral wires are swapped, the switch effectively breaks the neutral wire and the lamp
appears to behave correctly—by going off. However, all you have done is to cut off the return path for the electricity, so that
the current cannot flow.

THE LAMPHOLDER IS STILL LIVE! A slip when changing the bulb could lead to ELECTROCUTION.
:::

#### Old wiring

Wiring circuits should be checked at least every 20 years. Old wiring can be recognized by primitive bakelite plugs and fittings,
fabric-covered flex hanging from ceiling fittings and more than one fuse box.

In Britain two-pin sockets and plugs should be replaced with modern three-pin 13-amp fittings, when rewiring is done. Replacing the
sockets alone is not good enough.

:::danger[Warning]

Keep all flexes and leads as short as possible. Many falls and accidents are caused by tripping over trailing flexes! Taping cable to
the floor is a temporary safety measure, but you should consider installing new sockets where you actually want to use the equipment.

:::

#### Adaptors

Overloading a socket with an adaptor which can take several other plugs is NOT safe. Worse still, other adaptors may be joined on,
allowing still more plugs to be fitted! Not only will you overload the socket electrically, but literally as well. The adaptor will work
loose in the socket from the sheer weight of plugs and flexes. This can weaken electrical connections. Exposed pins may be touched,
risking electrocution. Have you got enough sockets to avoid this?

#### Extension leads

If you have to use extension leads inside your house, either you have not got enough sockets or the arrangement of furniture and
appliances means that your sockets are in the wrong positions. Multi-socket extension leads are undoubtedly safer than adaptors, but:

-   DON’T leave the lead coiled when in use. It will generate heat and possibly start a fire.
-   DON’T use the sockets if there is any sign of charring anywhere, even on the flex.
-   DON’T get portable sockets wet.
-   DON’T exceed the 3000-watt maximum that the socket on the wall could cope with.

Extension leads that bring power from sockets to hard-to reach places like lofts or gardens, temporarily, should be made of a flex
suitable for the power consumption and the length of run involved. Some cheap multi-socket extension leads have been found to be extremely
dangerous. If any problem occurs, discontinue use.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If you must extend the wiring on an appliance, NEVER join two wires by simply twisting the ends together—even if you bind the
join with electrical insulating tape. THIS IS UNSAFE. Use proper shielded protectors or junction boxes. Even an in-line switch means
that a new piece of flex could be joined on. It is preferable to fit a new longer flex. Since this means opening the appliance and
tampering with it, consult an expert.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

If a two-part connector or a plug/socket extension is used to extend a Hex, NEVER NEVER NEVER arrange this so that the live flex ends
with the exposed pins. It must end with the socket. If outdoors temporarily, wrap the connection in polythene for protection against
moisture. NEVER pull on an extended flex whilst in use. If you do, go back and check the connection.

:::info[KITCHEN AND BATHROOMS]

The kitchen with its numerous gadgets and the power-hungry oven creates a greater demand for electricity. Consider installing a
separate circuit. There is also the presence of water to consider—electricity and water are a very dangerous combination. Some
gadgets, such as irons, are handled a lot and flexes and connections can wear out.

In bathrooms, the main danger is the presence of water and the metal sanitary fittings, even if you’re only temporarily using
power tools. Protect yourself with an RCD/RCB/ELCB. Both rooms deserve special consideration, electrically speaking ([see ROOM CHECK: Kitchens and Bathrooms](#room-check)).

:::

### OUTDOOR CIRCUITS

If you require electricity outside the house for a garage, greenhouse, lighting or a water pump, proper weatherproof exterior fittings and
cables must be used.

All outdoor wiring should be fitted with RCDs/RCBs/ ELCBs, which should protect you immediately if a fault develops.

#### External wall lights

Porch lights can be run from the household supply, but the exposed wiring must be protected by a conduit. All connections MUST be
weatherproof. The lamp inside the fitment must be protected by a rubber skirt or cup which prevents contact with the connections.

#### Electricity for outbuildings

Supplies to outbuildings may be run off the domestic supply.

They can be carried overhead (up to 5m/15ft): Provide posts and a support wire (galvanized catenary wire). The wire should slope slightly
to encourage water to run off it. At the lower end the cable should have some slack arranged as a drip-loop to prevent water following the
cable all the way to the end connections. Keep overhead cables above head height and be aware of the possibility of wind damage.

They can also be carried underground (over 5m/15ft): Cables must be armoured (such as MICS—mineral insulated copper sheathed) and
run in a strong conduit. They should be run at the base of walls and fences if possible—or buried low enough to avoid damage from
digging.

The outdoor supply should be earthed, both from the main earth connection at the meter/consumer unit and also in the outbuilding. The
circuit should be fitted with an RCD/RCB/ ELCB. If the use of the outbuilding involves the need for more than one light and one socket, it
should be fitted with its own fuse box/consumer unit.

#### Garden sockets

It is possible to fit sockets in the garden, preferably in a sheltered location. Two main kinds of socket are available (and which claim
to be weatherproof). One has a hinged plastic cover which protects the socket when not in use. The other has a screw-on cover—each
plug that fits into it also has a cover fitted round the flex. WHEN the plug is inserted, the cover is screwed onto the socket, covering
the plug.

### OTHER OPTIONS

#### Low-voltage installations

Consider low-voltage lighting—even in the garden. Not only does it use a lot less power, it also works on such low voltages that
there is no danger of electrocution from the fittings. It has become common to use low-voltage lighting in shops, in gardens and (more
recently) in homes. Low-voltage pumps are also available for garden ponds and fountains.

Generally speaking, the mains supply is reduced by a transformer. If used for outdoor lighting, the transformer must be kept in the house,
garage or outbuilding.

Lighter cables may be used in conduits on walls, or buried—sleeved in a length of ordinary garden hosepipe. It is still important to
check that all connections are weatherproof.

:::danger[Warning]

A transformer should be properly housed and subjected only to the loads specified by the manufacturer. Transformers generate heat
while operating-even those which plug into a socket to operate electronic equipment. Ensure adequate ventilation and switch them off
when not in use.

:::

#### Cordless devices

More and more cordless devices are available. These are mainly irons and kettles. There is a base unit which is plugged into a socket and
carries full mains power. The ‘cordless’ appliance only receives power when it’s sitting in the base unit. The very nature of
these types of equipment means that a careful eye should be kept on them for signs of wear and tear, especially if water is involved.
Follow safety instructions.

Rechargeable devices such as power tools, food mixers, electric screwdrivers—even electric toothbrushes—are cordless when in
use, but must be returned to their recharging units. Check carefully for wear and tear. DON’T try to use the recharging unit for
anything except the tool it was intended for.

#### Rechargeable batteries

There are so many portable, expensive-to-run, battery operated devices on the market—especially personal stereos-that rechargeable
‘NiCad’ (nickel cadmium) batteries are becoming very common. These batteries do NOT last forever and overcharging can be
dangerous. Always follow instructions.

## **GAS**

Gas is a relatively cheap, clean fuel for cooking and domestic heating. Whether produced as a product of the coal industry (coal gas),
‘natural gas’, or in cylinders (propane and butane), it is extremely DANGEROUS—and should never be taken for granted. Coal
gas is highly poisonous—fatal cases of asphyxiation are very common. Some ‘natural’ gas, such as North Sea gas, is a lot
less poisonous, but will still make you very ill in sufficient concentration. Both are EXPLOSIVE—the tiniest spark could trigger a
devastating explosion.

#### The supply

The gas enters your premises via the service pipe, which ends with an isolating (on/off) valve, just before the meter. This valve is operated
by turning the spanner-like handle. It should move without too much effort—but it shouldn’t be loose either. If you have any
concerns about it, if you doubt you have the strength to turn it on and off, call the gas company and ask them to send someone to sort it out.

Pipes from the meter carry the gas around your home to each appliance. Each appliance will probably be connected by a fixed coupling, with or
without an on/off key—in some cases to an outlet point, with its own on/off key. It is usual for a flexible hose to be joined onto one
of these—the commonest being a gas cooker. The flexible hose allows the cooker to be eased forward for cleaning without disrupting the
supply.

All internal gas plumbing is made of copper, these days. If you find any pipes which appear to be lead composition or iron, they are likely to
be rather old. Get them checked!

:::danger[Warning]

Do NOT tackle even the simplest of gas installations or maintenance jobs yourself! Gas plumbing is a job for experts only. Any problem
with gas supplies or appliances should be reported immediately.

:::

### VENTILATION

To burn safely, all gas appliances MUST have a supply of fresh air. This may be supplied by normal room ventilation or through a balanced
flue, a system which draws air directly into the apparatus from outside the house and discharges fumes directly out again. This is also called
a ‘room-sealed’ system.

Never obstruct airbricks or attempt to seal off all draughts in a room where gas equipment is used. Beware double glazing!

Failure to ventilate could lead to the appliance using up all the available oxygen, possibly causing unconsciousness and subsequent
suffocation. It also increases greatly the risk of a build-up of carbon monoxide—a very poisonous gas which has no smell. You are only
likely to be aware of it when you begin to be subjected to its poisoning effects.

NEVER cover or lean anything against the external vent of a balanced flue. Obstructing the air flow could cause inefficient burning and the
production of poisonous fumes.

Gas appliances MUST be checked and serviced annually. Blocked jets and the accumulation of deposits may make the apparatus dangerous as well
as inefficient.

All gas burners give off carbon dioxide and water vapour. With permanent appliances these are taken away by the flue or chimney, but a fault
may sometimes discharge them into the room. Unvented appliances may cause severe condensation problems if room ventilation is poor.

#### Carbon monoxide

Explosions caused by leaking gas are frighteningly common, but four times as many people die from carbon monoxide poisoning. Unburnt gas does
not contain carbon monoxide-but it is produced if a gas appliance is not burning efficiently.

You cannot smell carbon monoxide, but breathing it for even fairly brief periods of time can be FATAL. Coal gas produces higher concentrations
of carbon monoxide than ‘natural’ gas. If gas appliances are installed by a professional and regularly serviced (once a
year)—and ventilation is adequate—the risk is minimized. Most cases of carbon monoxide poisoning involve gas appliances with
blocked flues or chimneys, or dangerous old gas water heaters in bathrooms.

Avoid cheap gas equipment from non-specialist dealers and only buy second hand equipment if you are willing to pay someone to completely
overhaul it to make sure it is safe.

Carbon monoxide is also produced by exhaust fumes from vehicles, oil burners, wood/coal/charcoal fires and bonfires. Always ensure adequate
ventilation. NEVER run the engine of a vehicle in a sealed garage!

#### Look for the danger signs

A yellow/orange flame indicates inefficient burning of the gas. Stains/soot/discolouration around the appliance may indicate that exhaust
gases are leaking into the room. A slightly gassy smell of burning may also indicate the presence of exhaust gases.

:::warning[EMERGENCY]

GAS LEAK

<div class="text-center">
![ ](/images/img038_002.jpg)
</div>

If you smell gas...  
If you suspect a leak...

IMMEDIATELY:

1. Extinguish cigarettes and any naked flames
2. Do NOT operate light switches, doorbells, telephones or any other electrical apparatus or open fridges/freezers. Switches cause a
   spark which could ignite the gas
3. Open doors and windows to dispel gas
4. Check! You may have left a burner unlit. A low burner or pilot light may have blown out
5. Turn off the supply at the meter
6. Call the gas emergency service—but NOT from a gas-filled room
7. Evacuate to a safe distance until help arrives

:::

#### Gas safety rules

-   All gas installations and maintenance MUST be done by experts—NEVER attempt to do any of the work yourself.
-   NEVER use, or allow to be used, an appliance which is known to be or suspected to be faulty in any way.
-   If you suspect a leak, turn off the supply at the meter and inform the gas company.
-   Gas must have a ready supply of air to burn efficiently. NEVER seal off all ventilation to a room.
-   NEVER fool around with gas. NEVER!

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Water is likely to damage your property when pipes leak or installation work is shoddy—but leaks are visible and easily sorted out.
Gas leaks can kill you, even before you have detected any problem.

:::

#### Old gas water heaters

Old gas water heaters which do not have a ‘balanced’ flue or ‘room-sealed’ flue (which takes its air supply and discharges its
exhaust through the wall) are EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. In some countries, such as Britain, it is now illegal to instal them. It may seem to work
well but-IF there is inadequate ventilation, IF the appliance is not serviced at least every six months, IF the flue is leaky, damaged or
blocked-THIS TYPE OF APPLIANCE CAN KILL.

-   NEVER seal off ventilation or airbricks.
-   NEVER use the heater while you are in the bath.
-   ALWAYS open the door and windows when you are using the heater.

#### Gas alarms

Unfortunately, there are no domestic gas alarms or detectors-although there are quite simple devices in use in industry. Some can even detect
the presence of carbon monoxide. Most people already have smoke alarms and, as soon as gas detectors become available, ‘every home should
have one’!

### BOTTLED/CYLINDER GAS

For those without a mains supply, two kinds of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are widely available: propane and butane. Neither has a
noticeable smell so a stenching agent is usually added. The smell is similar to that of mains gas.

Propane is not widely used indoors, because it is stored under great pressure, and this increases risk. When it is used to fire domestic
central heating, it is stored outside either in a bulk tank (which is replenished by a tanker) or in large cylinders beside the house. In
Britain, a maximum of four cylinders of 47kg capacity is permitted.

Butane cylinders are mainly used to fuel portable heaters. The cylinders of both gases should be treated with care. DON’T knock, handle
them roughly or bang them to see if they are empty. DON’T subject them to heat or leave them exposed to sunlight or rain.

Both propane and butane have other uses. Both may be used for blow-torches to burn off paint or braze metal. Butane is common as lighter fuel,
for camping gas and even cordless hair curlers ([see POISONS](/sas-urban/urban-poison)). REMEMBER that these gases are POISONOUS.

#### Changing cylinders

Follow manufacturer’s and supplier’s instructions to the letter. If these are incomplete or confusing, DON’T guess! Call in an
expert to show you how to change cylinders safely and easily.

:::danger[Warning]

Good ventilation is required to allow exhaust gases to escape-and to avoid the build-up of condensation. NEVER block established vents in
walls and windows or attempt to seal every draught from a room. Beware double glazing! You may need to provide extra ventilation.

:::

#### Portable heater dangers

FIRE! There are thousands of domestic fires every year caused by heaters which have been placed too close to furnishings, or knocked over.

Some portable heaters are fitted with a special safety device which shuts off the gas if there is insufficient air for combustion. SOME DO
NOT! Most shut off the supply if the pilot light goes out. SOME MAY NOT—or may not be working properly. Have the appliance serviced
regularly (once a year).

-   NEVER place anything over a heater—especially clothes for drying—many fires start like this!
-   NEVER position a portable heater in a corridor. It may be knocked over or block an escape route.
-   NEVER store gas cylinders below ground in a cellar or basement. Gas is heavier than air and could be undetected if a leak occurred,
    creating a severe fire risk.

-   AVOID inhalation of gases. Breathing low concentrations will cause dizziness and nausea. Higher concentrations may asphyxiate or lead to
    death.

-   AVOID contact with liquid gases. They can cause ‘burns’ similar to frostbite. Wash areas affected with warm water for at least ten
    minutes. Flush out eyes with warm running water for at least ten minutes. If in doubt—always seek medical attention.

-   KEEP CYLINDERS UPRIGHT-in case the valve leaks.
-   DON’T knock or kick containers—there is enormous pressure inside. Faults in the cylinder could lead to explosion.
-   NEVER use portable gas heaters in bathrooms or other small rooms where there is too little ventilation.
-   LEAKS: Turn off the cylinder immediately if you suspect a leak. Open doors and windows to ventilate. Take heater outdoors. If leak not
    immediately traceable, brush liquid detergent over connectors: it will bubble at the escape point.

-   NEVER leave a heater on when you intend to go to bed or go to sleep.
-   NEVER knock a heater over, especially when it is on. Liquid gas may escape causing a fire/explosion risk.

:::warning[EMERGENCY]
CYLINDER FIRE

<div class="text-center">
![ ](/images/img040_001.jpg)
</div>

In the event of a fire involving a gas cylinder:  
Turn off the gas at the cylinder  
Move it away from the flames  
Use a fire extinguisher on the flames

BUT

If you cannot reach the cylinder, or if the fire is spreading:  
GET OUT!  
Get well clear of the house, call the fire brigade and tell them a gas cylinder is involved in the fire

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Gas is heavier than air. A leak will always travel downwards, possibly downstairs, possibly accumulating in a basement. A leaky cylinder
stored in a basement could fill the basement with gas- as could a leak from a pipe under the floor above. If you smell gas, do not enter
the basement or switch lights all or on. Extinguish all naked flames/cigarettes. If you have a mains supply, turn it off at once-and
report the problem ([see EMERGENCY!: GAS LEAK panel](#look-for-the-danger-signs)).

:::

## **LIQUID FUEL**

 

Two grades of fuel oil—paraffin and gas oil-are common in domestic use. Both are a fire risk and should be treated with respect. Both
produce carbon monoxide when burning ([see Gas](#gas)). If a fire starts, the result may be the spillage of burning
liquid—which is extremely dangerous. Use a fire extinguisher—dry extinguisher is suitable—aimed at the base of the fire and
into the appliance.

### PARAFFIN

Paraffin is also known as kerosene. It is used for portable heaters and blow lamps, although many people still use old paraffin lamps (oil
lamps). In some appliances—heaters and oil lamps—the fuel soaks up a wick. Blow lamps and storm lanterns require the paraffin to
be pressurized by pumping air into the sealed paraffin reservoir.

#### Paraffin heaters

Paraffin heaters are safe when used properly, but are the cause of many fires. The heater must be placed on a level surface-away from
draughts. If you set it in a fireplace, partially block the chimney to reduce draughts. Check the flame is burning blue (not yellow or orange)
and not flickering in a draught.

It’s not advisable to buy second hand heaters. They may be dangerous. New ones supply a special trimmer for the wick. Use it every time
you fill the reservoir.

Make sure there is plenty of air coming into the room. Paraffin heaters will produce deadly carbon monoxide as well as water vapour, which can
lead to condensation problems. Don’t seal off every draught. Don’t block air bricks or fixed vents.

:::danger[Warning]

When going to bed, you MUST extinguish a paraffin heater. Do so at least 20 minutes before retiring, and give the heater a final check
before you leave it for the night. Make sure the wick is not still smouldering.

:::

#### Refilling tank

Always use paraffin-NEVER petrol. If reservoir is removable take it outdoors to refill. Use a funnel and wipe any spillages from reservoir
before replacing. It is easier to refill a detachable reservoir from a small storage tank with a draw-off tap than to pour paraffin from a
can—but keep the tank/can in the garden shed, if you have one, not the house.

:::warning[EMERGENCY!]

On no account try to carry a burning heater

SMOTHER THE FIRE  
Use a fire blanket or a dry powder (blue) extinguisher. Aim it right into the appliance or at base of flames

EVACUATE and call the fire brigade
:::

### GAS OIL

Gas oil is usually stored outside in large tanks and is piped to oil-fired boilers. All the safety and maintenance advice for gas and propane
boilers applies here ([see Gas](#gas)).

Oil-fired boilers and heaters need efficient chimneys or flues. When a boiler is serviced (annually), make sure that the chimney/flue is
cleaned out too. If the boiler has a balanced/ room-sealed flue (which takes in air for combustion and expels exhaust gases through an outside
wall), make sure nothing obstructs the flow of air around the vent outside.

#### Oil tanks

The tank for the oil must be well maintained. The main problem with these tanks is that any water that enters, sinks to the bottom and can
cause rusting. In Britain, the tanks may be used to hold a maximum of 3500 litres (770 gallons)—which is a lot of oil. Imagine the
problems you will incur if the tank is not well looked-after and the base of the tank suddenly gives way! There is a drain-off cock on some
tanks, at the bottom, to let any accumulated water out.

## **SOLID FUEL**



Once upon a time open fires were the only source of heating. They are inefficient and wasteful. A lot of the heat goes up the chimney—
polluting the atmosphere with several harmful by-products. In some areas only special smokeless fuels may be used to reduce atmospheric
pollution.

Closed stoves and cooking ranges are more efficient, radiating more of the heat into the room and making it possible to burn fuel more slowly.

All solid fuels produce ash, dust and soot, acids and tars when they burn. Some of this material collects in the chimney, reducing its
efficiency—which could be a very serious fire hazard. An inefficient chimney will also allow smoke and gases to fill the room where the
fire is burning. This is very dangerous. One of these gases will be carbon monoxide-inhalation of which, even for a short amount of time, can
be FATAL ([see Gas](#gas)).

The chimney should be swept annually, and once during the burning season. Apart from the risk of blockage and fire, acids in the soot and tar
will attack the lining of the chimney during the summer months.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

For a fire to burn well and safely, the chimney must be kept clear of obstructions and the room must have a good source of ventilation. As
warm air rises up the chimney, it takes with it potentially dangerous gases and the fire is able to draw on new supplies of air.

:::

#### Burning wood

Wet or unseasoned wood is no good for burning—if you can get it alight it will be smoky and possibly cause dangerous sparks. Seasoning
takes about two years—at the end of which time the wood looks drier and will have drying splits in the ends.

Provided they are well guarded and no flammable materials are left close by, stoves and heaters can be left burning slowly overnight, but get
a good blaze going in the morning to warm up the chimney.

#### Servicing

Apart from making sure the chimney is clean and efficient, check all flues and stoves for signs of smoke leakage. Firebacks in open fires may
need attention. They protect the chimney from the intense heat of the fire, so don’t allow large cracks to go unattended. Renew any fire
cement as it deteriorates.

## **WATER**



Water is one of our basic human needs, but attitudes to safe drinking water and levels of sanitation vary remarkably around the world. The
water system in most homes is prone to all sorts of problems, which may not be immediately life-threatening, but which can do a lot of damage
to your home and your peace of mind.

A leaky pipe may go ignored for months or years, especially if the outward signs are not very dramatic. But this leak may lead to structural
problems and rot. When the damage begins to show, the remedial work may be expensive or very difficult. Your home could become damp and smell
damp. Your health could suffer.

:::info[PLUMBING DECISIONS]

Simple plumbing jobs, such as changing the washer in a leaky tap or in the valve in a ball-cock assembly, are not very difficult and could
be attempted by the beginner. Larger jobs, which might result in having to turn the water off for days (while you feel your way through
the process) are not such a good idea. The work can also be quite strenuous.

Because plumbing for water is fairly simple in principle, with fairly low risk factors involved, many people ‘have a go’. The
plumbing in older homes and multi-occupied homes may be very difficult to follow as a result. There are numerous books on the market which
describe simple procedures, and the plumbers’ supply shop may be able to advise you. What neither of these can take into account are
the idiosyncrasies of your existing plumbing.

If money and the cost of plumbing work are your main worry, do-it yourself plumbing might be the answer. You may save money simply by
understanding what you are asking a plumber to do-how much work it is and the sort of material costs involved. You may make his job
quicker if you have already identified a problem before he arrives. If you attempt a difficult job and get in a mess, it may cost you more
to have a plumber sort it out.

Remember that several special tools are required. Some homes have virtually no tools at all. Do you want to buy an adjustable spanner or a
pipe bender for one job? Borrowing or hiring tools is a possibility.

:::

### WATER SUPPLY

 

Urban water supplies come from many sources-rivers, wells, reservoirs and underground springs. All of it is processed to offer safe drinking
water to the public, despite the fact that much of it is used for washing, flushing toilets and other things for which pure water is not
necessary.

Modern demands for water are putting increasingly heavy demands on supplies, especially in times of drought. Processing is costly and uses up
valuable energy resources. Economy in use is therefore a first priority in reducing pressure on the environment and on the pocket.

#### Pure water?

Water treatment is a very complicated business, involving settlement tanks, filtration beds and the addition of chemicals. Most water
authorities prefer the water going into the mains to be slightly alkaline—in order not to corrode the system. To ensure this, lime is
added, but only at about 20 parts per million. Other chemicals are used too, like ferrous sulphate to make impurities cling together so that
they can be filtered out more easily (about 18 parts per million).

A small amount of chlorine (about 5.5 parts per million) is used to kill off bacteria which may be present. By the time the water leaves the
treatment plant, the level of chlorine will have been reduced to less than one part per million.

Most chemicals added to water, such as the chlorine or copper from your own pipework, may affect the taste, but are harmless at the
concentrations at which they occur.

Other chemicals, which are known to be present in some supplies, are far from harmless. These include:

Aluminium: Sometimes added during water treatment. May be carried into reservoirs from the soil. May be naturally present. Links are being
considered with Alzheimer’s disease (premature senility). Water is unlikely to be a major source of aluminium—but it has been
suggested that water-borne aluminium is in a readily absorbed form.

Nitrates: Increase the risk of a rare blood disease which affects bottle-fed babies (whose feed is made up with tap water). Suspected (not yet
proven) link with cancer. Leached into supplies from fertilizers and manure in intensive farming. Very difficult to remove.

Lead: Most likely source is your own plumbing. Old pipework was made of lead (see panel below). Very serious. Can damage the brain and nervous
system, cause anaemia and affect the muscles, and stunt mental development in children.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: From coal tar pitch, used to coat the inside of mains pipes (taken out of use in the UK in the mid-1970s).
Suspected link with cancer.

Industrial chemicals: Such as industrial degreasing agents and dry cleaning fluid. Suspected link with cancer. These are among the numerous
chemicals pumped into streams and rivers when pollution controls are flouted.

:::info[LEAD]

Plumbing for water used to be made entirely of lead. In old houses this may still be the case. In updated systems, some lead piping may
still be found as the connection to the water mains. Lead poisoning is extremely serious and in some cases debilitating or fatal. It
attacks the brain and the nervous system. It affects the muscles. It causes anaemia. The effects can be devastating in young children.

Some of the lead we absorb is from atmospheric pollution, but levels found in water samples indicate that water-borne lead is a major
problem.

The problem is worse in areas with soft water, because the pipes do not develop a protective coating of limescale ([see Hard and soft water](#hard-and-soft-water)).
Soft water may even dissolve small quantities of lead as it travels through the pipes. No lead plumbing should be considered safe,
however.

The long-term solution is to have ALL lead plumbing removed and replaced—but be prepared for a major upheaval.

The short-term solution is to filter all drinking water ([see Filtering water](#filtering-water)). Never drink water that has
been standing in the pipes. Run the tap for a few minutes before drinking.

:::

Bacteria: Those of diseases spread by contact with human excreta are the most serious risk, though contamination is comparatively rare. In
areas where bacterial diseases such as cholera are endemic, local water should be avoided in favour of a safer alternative even though you may
be likely to be more at risk when you go swimming.

Fluoride: Most supplies contain minute amounts. There is disagreement about the safety of adding sodium fluoride to water supplies in some
countries/areas. This is done at a level of about one part per million, primarily to increase children’s resistance to dental
decay—and is effective at doing so.

Higher doses of fluoride during early tooth formation (possibly also because of fluoride dental treatments and fluoride supplements given to
children) have been shown to produce a mottling of the teeth. This is common and only a cosmetic problem.

Opinion as to whether there is any long-term health risk is divided-even scientific assessments have come up with conflicting results. In
Britain, very few water authorities add fluoride to their supplies. There may be a health risk if you ingest quantities of fluoride from other
sources as well (toothpaste, for instance). In higher doses (upwards of ten parts per million), fluoride is more widely believed to be a
health hazard.

#### Filtering water

Various filters are available. Some plumb directly into the drinking water pipe, others fit onto a tap. There are also two part jug
systems-tap water runs from a top section, through a filter, into a jug below. Most contaminants, including lead (but excluding nitrates), can
be reduced or removed—but the replaceable filters work best when new. Decide for yourself whether the benefits outweigh the cost.

#### Hard and soft water

Hard water basically contains more calcium and magnesium than soft water. The water filters described are good at removing ‘hardness’
when the filters are fairly new, yet there is evidence to suggest that hard water is better for you in some ways. Hard water dissolves less
lead from pipes—it coats them with limescale. Evidence suggests that there are more cases of heart disease in areas with soft water. If
this is true, the reasons have yet to be made clear.

Hard water can damage plumbing systems by ‘furring’ up the inside of pipes and appliances. There are softeners which can be fitted to
your system. The main one uses common salt to remove the ‘hardness’, another uses a magnetic field to prevent limescale forming.
Again, these are not cheap options. If you only want a ‘softer’ bath, soda or bath salts will reduce scum and the amount of soap
needed.

There are various commercial treatments to de-scale systems and appliances. Consult a dealer or plumber who will tell you if your system needs
such attention.

:::danger[Warning]

If you install a sodium-based water softening device, it is advisable NOT to include the main drinking water tap. Drinking sodium-softened
water all the time could add marginally to your body’s sodium levels. Also, removing all calcium from the water you drink may not be a
good idea.

:::

#### Boiling water/purifying tablets

Boiling water for several minutes should kill off most bacteria, which are not normally present in correctly-processed drinking water. This
should only be necessary if there is a declared emergency, or if supplies are from a primitive source.

Water-purifying tablets are available, but these are only really intended for short-term use—while on holiday for example. Follow
manufacturer’s instructions.

### DOMESTIC SYSTEMS

Before the water enters your premises, there is usually a heavy-duty stopcock (on/off valve) which is intended for use by the water company.
Inside your premises, there should be another stopcock/gate valve so that the entire supply to your home can be isolated. Make sure you can
operate this valve. In some areas there is also a meter, which registers the amount of water you have used.

#### Indirect systems

The supply will feed at least one tap directly-this is your drinking water. The rest of the taps or appliances in your home are usually fed by
a large tank containing 189 litres (50 gallons) or more. This tank is actually a large heavy cistern and is often situated in the loft space.

:::info[TANK/CISTERN]

The height of the cistern above your taps and other outlets determines your internal water pressure. This is known as the ‘head of
water’. The cistern is so heavy that it is important to check that the supporting timbers are strong enough and not deteriorating from
rot or insect infestation.

The cistern should be protected from freezing by lagging. Loft insulation is not carried under the tank. Any warmth filtering up from the
rooms below is useful to help prevent freezing.

Like most cisterns, this tank contains a floating ballcock which cuts off the intake when the desired level of water is reached. When you
use water, the level falls allowing the ballcock to drop—opening the inlet valve—so more water enters the tank to refill it.
Keep the tank covered and check that it’s clean and in good repair. Everything from rotting wood to dead birds and rats have been
found in loft cisterns.

:::

In indirect systems there is usually a sealed hot-water tank (keep well lagged)—usually in a cupboard, bathroom or kitchen. This heats
water, either by an electric immersion heater (like an electric kettle), or by heat exchange from a coiled pipe inside the tank. This coiled
pipe is fed with hot water by the central heating boiler.

Often, also in the loft, will be a smaller cistern which feeds water to water-filled central heating systems. Both hot water tanks and
water-filled central heating systems require ‘expansion pipes’, which are open-ended to release bubbles and steam. These are usually
allowed to drip back into the respective feed cistern. DON’T block these pipes. If a fault develops, water may boil in the pipes. Pressure
MUST be allowed to escape.

All cisterns are fitted with an overflow or warning pipe (which drains through an outside wall) in case they overfill.

#### Direct systems

As water enters the premises, it feeds all the outlets in turn. Hot water is achieved by taking the water through a boiler-or, in some cases,
there may still be a hot-water tank with an overhead cistern.

Scaling of pipes and appliances is more of a problem with direct systems in hard water areas. Water-filled heating systems are usually still
fed by a cistern, and protected by an expansion pipe.

#### Which is best?

In indirect systems, most of the water is isolated from the mains supply—so if the water in the house becomes contaminated, it cannot
syphon back and affect the mains supply. The pressure from the tank is constant—which is ideal for showers and other appliances which
need to receive hot and cold water at roughly the same pressure.

Direct systems are easier to understand and may even be cheaper, but—apart from the possibility of limescale damage—special
appliances and controls may be needed to avoid contamination of the mains supply.

#### You’re in control

You MUST know where every stopcock/gate valve is, to be able to isolate all or part of your system. If you trace your pipes, you will find
valves to isolate feeds to and (in most cases) from loft cisterns. At the lowest point on most systems—not only central heating
systems—there is usually a special drain-off tap, to which a hose may be fitted for speedy draining.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

It’s not enough to know where these stopcocks/gate valves are. You must check regularly that they are working efficiently BEFORE an
emergency arises—which is exactly the wrong time to start learning about plumbing!

It’s a good idea to fit an isolating valve under EVERY tap or before every appliance to make it possible to perform routine
maintenance—such as curing leaks and changing tap washers—without having to drain down the relevant parts of the system. Pumps
on showers and central heating systems should always have isolating valves—or even proper gate valves—to allow regular
servicing.

:::

### WASTE SYSTEMS

Waste pipes are now usually made of plastic, although older houses may still have lead or galvanized piping. All pipes carrying water away
incorporate a trap—the U-bend, S-bend, P-trap or bottle-trap—which partially fills with water to prevent smells from the drains
coming back into the house. In the toilet this is built into the fitment, but on other outlets it forms the first section of the piping.

In most houses all the waste pipes are connected to a single vertical soil pipe, which carries the water down to the drains and into sewers.
This pipe is extended upwards to roof level where its top is left open to act as a vent for smells. It also prevents suction (produced by the
pull of water running through the pipes) from drawing water out of any of the individual traps.

Sometimes WCs are connected to a soil pipe, while baths, basins and other wastes feed into a separate waste pipe. These pipes go to the sewers
via a gully trap, into which external drains and rainwater run-off pipes also discharge.

:::danger[Warning]

Cracked or broken drain inspection covers should be replaced. There is a risk of disease-carrying bacteria being released or carried away
by flies. Debris may fall in and block the drain.

:::

#### Cesspools and septic tanks

Even in cities there are sometimes premises not connected to a main sewer, either because they are very old properties predating the sewage
system or because topography makes mains sewerage impossible.

A cesspool is a lined hole in the ground where sewage collects. When full it has to be emptied. It must be sealed so that sewage cannot escape
and water cannot get in from surrounding ground. It should be childproof!

A septic tank is a small-scale sewage treatment system. Two chambers are usual. In the first tank, bacteria break down waste into a harmless
liquid. The second is a filter bed. Sludge from a septic tank requires emptying in a city environment, but not as frequently as a cesspool
(perhaps once a year instead of once a week or once a month).

DON’T use excessive quantities of disinfectants, bleaches or household detergents. If the bacteria in the chambers are killed you might
slow down the reaction—clogging the tank.

### COMMON PROBLEMS

Blocked wastepipes: First attempt to remove the blockage with a suction-cup plunger, if there is water which won’t run away. If the water
has run away, but very slowly, and there is a trap in the first section of pipe, open the trap. Hair, grease, food and other debris should be
cleaned out and the trap reconnected. If there is no trap, just a loop in the pipe, and the water has gone, try a chemical drain
clearer-following the manufacturer’s advice ([see POISONS](/sas-urban/urban-poison)).

Sometimes it is necessary to disconnect the waste pipe from the appliance and push something down the pipe to clear the blockage. A length of
hosepipe may work, particularly if connected to a running tap—but BEWARE of the backwash, particularly if you have tried using a
chemical drain clearer. If nothing works, call in an expert.

Tank/cisterns overflowing: A stream of water is issuing from an external overflow/warning pipe. The ballcock is allowing the tank to overfill,
It may have jammed. It may be adjusted too high. It may have filled with water so that it is not floating. Most likely the washer or diaphragm
on the inlet valve needs replacing—to make it cut off the water supply when the water level is correct.

:::danger[Warning]

Overflowing water in winter may create a slippery ice patch on the ground below. Accidents do happen! The water may also freeze as it
leaves the pipe. This freezing may travel back to the cistern. Fix the simple problem-and save having to deal with even worse ones.

:::

Freezing pipes/tanks/cisterns: The whole water system should be lagged to prevent freezing. Don’t carry loft insulation under
cisterns—they need all the warmth they can get. If a pipe freezes, the expansion of the ice may split the pipe or force a joint apart.
When it thaws you will get very wet! If freezing occurs, turn off hot water and central heating systems—the water is not flowing and
this equipment may overheat.

Thawing should be done with great care, and only on identified areas of freezing. If the whole system is frozen you may need to call in a
specialist. Don’t use blow torches or hot-air strippers. You may melt plastic pipes—or the solder at (capillary) joints. A hairdryer
is fine, used with care—but be careful of spurting water if dealing with a split pipe (turn off the stopcock!). An electric fire, used
with great care, may be all right to gently warm a cistern—but supervise constantly.

Leaky joints: There are two main types of plumbing joint- soldered (capillary) joints and larger compression fittings which have to be
tightened with spanners or wrenches. Problems at soldered joints mean that the whole system has to be drained of water. Compression fittings
may be gently tightened (if they are recent fittings)—but beware of over tightening. Consult a specialist.

Leaky taps: When taps leak from the spout, the washer needs replacing. If they leak from the top, the packing or O-ring seal is faulty.
Don’t keep tightening a leaky tap, you may wear down the seating for the washer and then the whole tap may need to be replaced.

Central heating overheating: Can be very serious, may be for any of a number of reasons:

-   The chimney or balanced flue (room-sealed flue) may be blocked. Clear all obstructions.
-   The system could have become loaded with limescale. It will need draining down and treating by a specialist.
-   The thermostat on the boiler may be faulty. Shut the system down and call a specialist.
-   The main thermostat or programmer may be faulty. Shut the system down and call a specialist.
-   The pump may not be working (you can hear it running, or feel a slight vibration if you touch it). Shut the system down. The pump must be
    isolated and serviced.

-   A motorized valve may be stuck. Most systems include at least one electrically-operated valve which controls water flow. This is quite a
    common problem. Shut the system down and have the valve replaced. In most cases, only the tiny motor needs replacing—which means you
    won’t have to drain the system.

Radiator problems: If a radiator stays cool at the top, there is air in the system. You could be damaging the system. Buy a key and gently
‘bleed’ the radiators. Slowly and carefully undo the valve, holding a cloth ready to stem the flow of water. Air hisses as it escapes,
bubbles follow—when water flows, quickly close the valve. Bleed all radiators at the beginning, middle and end of the heating season as
part of simple routine maintenance.

If a radiator is cool in the middle and cold at the bottom, you have a build up of sludge, corrosion particles and debris which need flushing
from the system. Consult a specialist, before the system is damaged.

If either of the above is allowed to continue for too long, radiators may be damaged beyond repair. In the worst cases, a radiator may
pinhole—spurting water under pressure!

:::warning[EMERGENCY]
BURST PIPE/TANK FLOOD

<div class="text-center">

</div>

-   Locate main stopcock and turn it off
-   If water has reached an electrical appliance or light fitting:DON’T touch the appliance
    Go to the fuse box/consumer unit and cut the power

-   Turn on all the taps, to drain the pipes and tank
-   Turn off your central heating/immersion hot water heater

#### BURST PIPE

If you can locate the actual source of the leak, a do-it-yourself repair may be possible. Repair ‘kits’ include hose clips (A) or
epoxy putty (B). Otherwise call a specialist.

<figure class="text--center">

#### BURST TANK

If the tank is leaking, turn off the supply to the tank—or tie up the ballcock to prevent the tank refilling. You may now be able to
turn the main stopcock back on again to get drinking water.  

<figure class="text--center">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img046_003.jpg" />

#### YOU COULD TRY

If the patch of damp is on a ceiling and is dripping, it could be worth making a small hole in the centre with a small screwdriver. Stand
on a stepladder, NOT a chair. Don t forget to have a couple of buckets ready to catch the water.

If the leak is very bad and the ceiling is drooping-and dripping in the centre—be VERY careful. Piercing the bulge may be possible.
It would be safer to evacuate the room if the ceiling looks likely to fall.

## **COMMON ACCIDENTS**

 

Casualties from accidents in the home are more numerous than those on the roads. Everyone is at risk, particularly children under four-with
peak risk at two-and the elderly. The kitchen is the most dangerous room, it seems, with up to 25 per cent of accidents related to it.
First-aid advice given here is abbreviated as a reminder for emergencies only.

:::note[PLEASE NOTE]

All [EMERGENCY!](/sas-urban/urban-poison#major-risks) and [SAVE A LIFE!](/sas-urban/urban-health#save-a-life) panels are intended only to
guide you through emergency procedures, and to avoid the need to search through the pages of this book in a crisis. More detailed
instructions appear in the HEALTH chapter. Learn the procedures BEFORE you need to use them.

:::

### FALLS

The most common of all accidents. Usually caused by loose or worn carpeting, slipping or tripping on toys or other objects left on the floor
and stumbling over appliance flexes. The majority of accidents involve vacuum cleaners—caused by tripping over or stepping backwards on
to them! Bad lighting is often a contributory factor.

Children under two try to walk or crawl up- or downstairs before they are physically ready to do so. Even as they get older, children are
easily thrown off balance if they catch a toe on a piece of carpet or slip on a shiny floor. Rushing round a corner, they may fail to judge
their speed sufficiently well to stop.

Falls from windows account for many deaths and injuries, especially for children. Low windows, especially those with climbable objects in
front of them, are the most dangerous. Balcony rails which can be squeezed through or climbed are another serious risk.

:::warning[SAVE A LIFE!]
FALLS

<div class="text-center">
![ ](/images/img047_003.jpg)
</div>

There may be no cuts and bruises, but internal injuries are possible. Concussion is likely after a blow to the head. Even worse,
compression may develop—which is life-threatening. ALWAYS seek medical attention.

:::

Worn and loose floor coverings can be a real hazard. Non-slip mesh is available in two versions to stabilize rugs on polished floors or to
prevent them creeping on carpets.

-   Repair any rents, which could catch either toe or heel, or replace.
-   Ensure rugs don’t curl up at the edges.
-   Don’t polish the floor beneath rugs.
-   Keep stair coverings close fitting.
-   Avoid loose mats at top or bottom of stairs.

Steps up and down, especially shallow ones, are a frequent site for falls, as are changes in width of the treads of stairs (when the stairs
turn a corner). Though interior decoration usually seeks to unify a space, this is a case for different treatments of the surface to make the
change more noticeable. Good lighting is essential in all such situations.

### SUFFOCATION

Plastic bags, wrappings, clear kitchen film and even uninflated balloons commonly cause suffocation. Plastic bags are convenient and
reusable-so less wasteful of energy than paper if you get a lot of use out of them-but punch a hole or two in them as air vents, just in case
a child sticks its head inside. Most products today are overwrapped-thin plastic films can easily suffocate if placed over the face. Dispose
of them as soon as possible. Tell suppliers you don’t need their wrappings! Make sure a child doesn’t raid the waste bins!

:::warning[SAVE A LIFE!]
SUFFOCATION

<div class="text-center">
![ ](/images/img047_005.jpg)
</div>

Remove cause-it it is a plastic bag, tear it away from the mouth and nose. If breathing has stopped or is very weak, apply artificial
respiration. If heartbeat has stopped, apply [cardiac compression](/sas-urban/urban-health#cardiac-compression). DON’T give up if
suffocation has just occurred. Seek urgent medical attention. For choking [see SAVE A LIFE!: Choking](#suffocation).

:::

It’s not necessary to cover the whole head to cause suffocation. Plastic films may be sucked into the mouth, small objects can easily
block a windpipe. Never let young children play with small or breakable toys—and choose sweets carefully. Even peanuts are dangerous to
young children.

:::warning[SAVE A LIFE!]
CHOKING

<div class="text-center">
![ ](/images/img048_001.jpg)
</div>

If you believe that there is a blockage in the windpipe, you must act quickly. Remove any matter, including loose dentures (leave fixed
ones), from the mouth or throat.

CHILD OR BABY  
Lay the child or baby over your lap, with the head hanging downwards. Slap sharply-the younger the casualty, the gentler you should
be-between the shoulder blades three to four times to dislodge the obstruction.

ADULT  
Try to get casualty to sit, bending over so that head is lower than lungs. Strike sharply between the shoulder blades three to four times
to dislodge the obstruction.

IF THIS DOES NOT WORK  
[Apply Heimlich manoeuvre/abdominal thrust](/sas-urban/urban-health#heimlich-manoeuvre).

IF BREATHING STARTS  
Get casualty comfortable and reassure. Sips of water may be given.

IF UNCONSCIOUS  
Place in [recovery position](/sas-urban/urban-health#recovery-position). Seek URGENT medical assistance.

IF BREATHING DOES NOT START  
Apply artificial respiration. An unconscious casualty’s throat may have relaxed sufficiently for you to get air past the obstruction
into the lungs. CALL AN AMBULANCE.

:::warning[EMERGENCY]
BURNS/SCALDS

<div class="text-center">
![ ](/images/img048_002.jpg)
</div>

-   Remove the source of heat
-   Reduce the temperature of the burn/scald in cold water Use running water, if burned by chemicals

SMALL PAINFUL BURNS  
Remove jewellery and clothing in the area (in case swelling starts).  
When cooled, cover wound with clean material-preferably non-fluffy. Seek medical attention.

SMALL CHARRED BURN (WITH LITTLE PAIN)  
Burn may be more serious, and quite deep. Cover as before. Burns must receive medical attention.

LARGER BURN-4cm (1.5in) ACROSS OR MORE  
Treat as above. MEDICAL ATTENTION IS URGENT.

LARGE BURNS/SCALDS  
Involving a limb, head, face, torso.  
CALL AN AMBULANCE. Lay victim down, with burnt side uppermost if at all possible.

IF UNCONSCIOUS  
Place victim in [recovery position](/sas-urban/urban-health#recovery-position).

#### REMEMBER

Remove jewellery and clothing which will constrict if swelling should start. DON’T try to remove clothing sticking to burns. Cover
with clean dressing.

SHOCK  
Most burns of any seriousness involve shock. Don’t give the shock victim anything to drink or eat. Don’t excite or move the
casualty.

DON’T  
Don’t touch burns or prick blisters. Don’t apply any sort of ointment or fat. Don’t use sticking plaster, coverings should be
loose and fluff-free.

:::

### BURNS/SCALDS

The main causes of injury are when children, especially toddlers, tip over saucepans/flying pans on cooker hobs, or when children pull kettles
off work surfaces. Some sort of safety fence should be fitted round the hob. Handles should NEVER be left sticking out from the hob area, as
these are a risk for adults, too. Jugs, teapots and cups of hot drink cause many injuries. NEVER drink hot drinks with a child sitting on your
lap.

Everyone, especially children, should note how hot the external casing of ovens and cookers become. Irons and kettles, when switched off, do
not cool down for some time—a child might think it’s safe to touch these. Steam from a boiling kettle can scald.

Young children should not supervise the running of their own baths. Nasty scalds could happen, quite apart from any subsequent accidents which
might occur in the panic when the child realizes its mistake.

Switch off irons and move them to a safe place to cool down when you have finished using them or if the doorbell/phone rings when there are
children about—or take the child with you to answer the door/phone.

### FIRE

The most common cause of accidental death in the home. Nearly half of all fires are known to be started by electrical faults ([see FIRE!](/sas-urban/urban-fire)).

### POISONING

Information about chemical hazards and poisoning-their effects and how to treat them—can be found in
[POISONS](/sas-urban/urban-poison).

### ELECTRICAL DANGERS

Children are inquisitive. They will stick things into empty sockets—use childproof covers. You MUST understand the risks of electricity
([see Electricity](#electricity)).

### GLASS

Ordinary window glass shatters easily, breaking into sharp-edged, often dagger-like pieces. Areas which are more vulnerable to impact should
be fitted with safety glass instead. There are two main kinds.

Toughened glass is processed to be five times stronger than ordinary glass, withstanding both rapid temperature change and impact. Instead of
breaking into large pieces, it shatters into small granules. It must be ordered to size.

Laminated glass consists of layers of glass bonded together with a strong clear plastic film between them. It absorbs some of the energy of
impact, and reduces the danger of flying fragments of glass. However, this sort of glass should never be used in the home for a window which
might need to be used as an escape route—in a fire, for example. It can be VERY difficult to break through.

Ordinary glass can be made safer by applying a special adhesive film to the surface. This stays clear once fixed and holds the glass together
if it is broken.

Many accidents involve people walking into doors or even windows which they have not seen. Glass partitions, including windows onto patios and
balconies, should have barriers which prevent people walking right up to them or decoration on the panel which will draw attention to its
surface. Glass doors should always carry some form of decoration. Though the glass may not shatter, the impact can do considerable injury.

:::warning[EMERGENCY!]
BLEEDING

<div class="text-center">
![ ](/images/img049_006.jpg)
</div>
Small cuts may be cleaned and dressed. If bleeding does not stop, cover with a dressing and apply pressure to control it.

### LARGE WOUNDS/SERIOUS BLEEDING

Call for an ambulance. Cover with a dressing and apply pressure, elevating the bleeding limb. If necessary, hold the wound closed. If
there is a foreign body in the wound, do not attempt to remove it-it may stem some of the bleeding.

:::

## **ROOM CHECK**

 

Make a close inspection of your home and consider the risks which each room presents to you and your family. Do not forget the hazards posed
for the very young and the elderly. Even though they may not be part of your live-in family, your home should also be safe for visitors.

### KITCHEN

A safe kitchen is a kitchen planned for efficiency. Work surface, cooker, sink, cupboards and equipment should be arranged to minimize
movement between them. You will find, in most kitchens, that you usually move in a triangle when preparing food. The points of the triangle
are usually fridge/sink/cooker. Avoid any triangular arrangement which crosses another access route.

#### Watchpoints

COOKERS Avoid placing the cooker under a window or next to a door. It would be easy to burn yourself reaching across to open the window. Pots
could be knocked when coming through the door. In both positions draughts could blow out low flames on a gas cooker. With built-in ovens check
the position of air-vents which may blow hot air out at you. Beware of external cooker surfaces, they can get hot enough to give you a bad
burn. Don’t stand over the oven door when opening it—the blast of hot air and steam could be nasty.

Have heat-resistant working surfaces next to the hob and oven to take hot pans and dishes. Have the sink within easy reach for
draining/straining and for transferring heavy pans for washing. Clean the cooker regularly—the build-up of grease and dirt around an
oven can become a fire hazard. Cookers on wheels (with a flexible attachment to the mains in the case of gas supplies) enable a thorough
cleaning job to be done behind as well as all over the oven itself.

STORAGE Store all food and equipment close to the place where it will be used: for instance, place vegetable storage near the sink. Avoid
placing cupboards or shelving over the hob, or hanging anything there. Reaching over it could easily set clothes alight. Do not warm or store
dishes above the hob for the same reason. If you have to use high cupboards, do not keep frequently-used objects in them. Get a set of kitchen
steps rather than standing on chairs or stools.

DANGER Do not have plugs for kettles or appliances near the hob—flex trailing across the burners or hotplates could easily be charred or
burned. Do not have television or mains radios near the sink or where leads have to pass near the cooker. Keep electric flexes well away from
water and places where they could constitute an ELECTROCUTION hazard.

FLOORS Keep floors clean and mop up spillages immediately-spills can make them dangerously slippery—but avoid unnecessary polishing.
Carpets are not usually practicable in a kitchen—though types are now available which are easily cleaned—NEVER use loose rugs in a
kitchen.

PLUS Many people feed pets in the kitchen but cats or dogs under the feet, especially if pestering for food, can be a hazard. Do not allow
cats on work surfaces. Can you find a more appropriate pets’ corner? Keep the kitchen well-ventilated. Cooking produces a lot of steam and
a washing machine in the kitchen will add to that. Condensation not only steams up windows but can make floors slippery too.

:::info[CHILDPROOFING]

Remote areas may receive mains power on a non-earthing system, whereby current trying to run to earth is fed back into the mains along the neutral wire. These systems are rare and are governed by strict regulations. Do NOT attempt to make changes to the system yourself, unless you are a qualified electrician. This system is sometimes known as a protective multiple earth.

-   If you need to have small children in the kitchen, keep them out of harm’s way by constructing a partition so that they are out of
    the work area.
-   Fit child-resistant catches on low-level cupboards—especially if you keep bleaches and cleaners underneath the sink. Ideally,
    store potential poisons out of a child’s reach.
-   Keep knives and other dangerous equipment out of sight of children.
-   Fit a guard round the hob so that pans cannot be pulled down from it. If possible, cook on back rings, where handles are out of reach.
-   Split-level, high-set ovens will keep one danger area out of reach of very small children.
-   Avoid flexes hanging from kettles, irons or other electrical equipment, which children could pull. Coiled flexes are safer than
    trailing ones. Keep kettles at the back of work sudaces—out of reach and sight of toddlers.
-   Do not use long tablecloths which children could tug, pulling hot food and sharp utensils down on top of them.
-   Teach children that cookers-not just hobs but oven doors and sides-are hot and can burn.
-   Children use drawer units as stepladders. Fit latches to lock drawers.
-   Don’t store children’s drinks where you keep alcohol.

:::

#### Electric cookers

Some small cookers, including microwaves, are below 3000W rating, and can be connected to a 30-amp ring main circuit. Most ordinary electric
cookers are over 3000W and require a separate circuit, run directly from the consumer unit, via a cooker control unit which must be within 2m
(6ft 6in) of the cooker. This unit has an isolating switch, but is sometimes combined with a socket for use with an electric kettle or other
appliances. The gauge of cable used and the fuses required will depend upon the power consumption of the cooker, which should be indicated on
the appliance ([see Electricity](#electricity)).

Some ovens use a cleaning system in which the surfaces are specially coated and the oven is run at a high temperature to burn dirt off. Follow
the instructions carefully. In all other cases ensure that the oven and/or rings are switched off before starting to clean.

#### Microwave ovens

Microwave ovens cook food through the action of high frequency radio waves which quickly penetrate the food, vibrating the water molecules
within it to produce heat and rapid cooking. Leakage of microwaves can have harmful effects, but ovens have to meet official safety
requirements. If the door or seals of an oven appear damaged, or its performance changes, get it checked—do NOT take risks.

DON’T allow grease or dust to accumulate around the seal or door frame. The door must close properly. DON’T peer closely through the
door at regular intervals. Leakages are more dangerous inches from the oven.

:::danger[Warning]

Microwave radiation is very dangerous. In perfect condition, ovens are designed so that the radiation is entirely contained and is
switched off when the door is opened. Nevertheless any tampering with the system or inefficient cleaning could result in radiation being
released. NEVER allow an unqualified person to attempt to repair a microwave. If you suspect any malfunction take it to the suppliers or
their service centre.

:::

Ovens MUST cut out when the door is opened and some are now equipped with cut-out mechanisms if they become overheated—but there is a
considerable risk of fire if food is allowed to cook for too long or instructions are not followed.

NEVER put oven foil, metal dishes or dishes decorated with metal in a microwave. Since many ceramic colour glazes and paints contain metallic
elements, it is safest to use only dishes which are designed for microwave ovens.

Always check that the time you have set reads accurately on the timer digital display. It is particularly easy to mis-key touchpad controls.
Adding an extra digit could have serious repercussions.

Set to the minimum cooking time—you can always reset for a little longer but you can’t uncook a burned-up plateful.

Clean the oven carefully after use, following the maker’s instructions. Spillages which are recooked can easily overheat and burst into
flame

#### Gas cookers

Older-style, self-igniting gas rings using a pilot light make siting of a gas cooker particularly important. If the pilot jet blows out, the
kitchen could fill with gas. ALWAYS check to see that a ring has lit—and stayed alight.

If matches are used to light the cooker, do NOT leave them on the top of the stove. They could all catch fire—or fall down beside the
cooker and ignite there later.

Match the pot to the size of the ring and do not turn flames high enough to reach up the sides of pans.
Always close oven doors gently. A slam could create a draught of air which blows out the gas jets if they are turned low by the thermostat.

#### Fat fires

A commonly-occurring cooking hazard—a pan of hot fat catches alight. This can happen with both shallow and deep frying. Use a pan with a
lid—and keep the lid close by so that you can replace it, cutting off the oxygen supply to the flames and extinguishing the fire. If you
have a fire-blanket—a must for every kitchen approach with the blanket raised to protect your face, and smother the flames. If you have
no lid or blanket use a chopping board or damp towel. Don’t forget to turn off the heat source. Don’t move the pan until the fat
cools.

Keep careful control of fat temperature and level and do not place wet food into the fat. Dry it first on kitchen paper. Wet food may make fat
spit and increase the risk of igniting. Watch out how much fat you use in a pan—as soon as food is added, the level will rise. This is
because of the volume of the food itself and the bubbling action of the fat as it is added. Most fires start at this point during cooking.

Automatic deep fryers with a thermostat to prevent overheating avoid the need to monitor the frying so closely—but do not stand the
fryer immediately in front of the socket into which it is plugged. A fire is unlikely unless the control breaks down, but you need to be able
to switch it off easily. When you open the lid, watch out for a cloud of steam!

Automatic fryer or not, a large volume of hot oil can take a couple of hours to cool down!

### REMEMBER

Low cooker extractor hoods may draw flames up into them. Smother the flames around the pan first. Then switch off the extractor and aim a
dry extinguisher into it.

#### Refrigerators/freezers

Refrigerators have made life much safer by enabling us to keep perishable foods in good condition, at least for short periods. Freezers give
the convenience of being able to prepare meals far in advance and to take advantage of seasonal price differences. However, they must be kept
clean, free of ice build-up and at the correct temperatures if they are to do their job efficiently and safely.

When defrosting fridges, put the contents into a coolbox or an insulated pack-the kind used for bringing frozen food back from the frozen-food
store. When defrosting the freezer, you may be able to transfer some of the contents to the frozen food compartment of a fridge-otherwise use
the insulated bags again. If they are not available, wrap frozen items in layers of newspaper. Do not allow frozen food to thaw (or even
partially thaw) and then refreeze. Depending on the type of food, this can be dangerous.

Fridges and freezers usually have a thermostat with a numbered scale, but it cannot give you an accurate idea of their temperature. A fridge
should be kept at 2-5&deg;C (35-40&deg;F), while a freezer should be -18&deg;C (-0.4&deg;F) or colder. Make regular checks by leaving a
thermometer in the ‘warmest’ part for at least a couple of hours, then taking a reading. In a fridge put the thermometer in the middle
of the top shelf. In an upright freezer place at the top front edge on the side the door opens, or in the top basket of a chest freezer. It is
a good idea to leave a thermometer permanently attached in these positions.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Fridges should be kept at a temperature below 5&deg;C (40&deg;F) if they are to be cold enough to inhibit the growth of
bacteria—which will still develop slowly as long as the temperature is above freezing point.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Fridges and freezers can be coffins, especially chest freezers with latches which hold the lids tightly closed. It can be impossible to
open them from the inside. When defrosting lock the room or garage they are in-a child might not freeze to death but could suffocate,
since the air supply would soon he used.

:::

#### Food processors/mixers

Modern electric food processors, with their rapidly-turning blades, look much more dangerous than the old-fashioned kinds. However, most of
them will not work until a safety cover is securely in place and offer no danger in use—provided that you follow all the operating
instructions and don’t overload the motor. Old-fashioned mincing machines were more likely to trap the fingers and graters can more easily
take a chunk out of them. However, modern blades should be handled with caution, especially when washing them, and still stored out of the
reach of children.

Always unplug electrical appliances before wiping or removing parts for washing. NEVER put the motor unit in water. Wipe it with a slightly
damp cloth.

Follow the makers’ instructions regarding running time and the type and quantity of food it can process. If the motor-casing becomes hot,
switch off and allow it to cool down. If it seems to be getting hot regularly, or smells hot, or if the motor sounds under strain, you may be
misusing it in some way, or it may need servicing.

#### Electric kettles and jugs

ALWAYS unplug before filling. Keep and use the kettle on a firm surface, well away from the edge. Do not leave the flex dangling—or
plugged in and switched on, while not connected to the kettle. Live flex hanging over a sink, or even on a surface where liquids could be
spilled, could easily make contact with water and short-circuit—at worst cause ELECTROCUTION.

It’s best to shorten the flex, so that there is just enough to comfortably reach the kettle from the socket. Or fit a curly cable instead,
to avoid trailing flexes which a child could grab.

Descale the kettle regularly. Scale build-up could affect the automatic cut-out device—or cause overheating.
:::danger[Warning]

All electrical appliances generate heat in use. Follow manufacturers’ instructions carefully concerning running times and safe
ventilation. Fitted-in appliances must have adequate ventilation and insulation to avoid a fire risk.

:::

#### Toasters

Few people switch off toasters when not in use. You should, to avoid children ‘toasting’ things—like paperback books! Make sure
you regularly empty out all crumbs/debris from the toaster. If this accumulates, overheating may occur. NEVER place the toaster so that
anything can interfere with the pushdown operating lever.

Tests have shown that some toasters can melt dramatically and burst into flame in these circumstances. Some toasters only stop heating the
elements when the lever returns to the ‘up’ position. NEVER fiddle about inside a toaster with a metal utensil. If your toast gets
stuck, first switch off and unplug. Then free the toast with a plastic or wooden spatula-but avoid touching the elements.

#### Washing machines

NEVER leave switched on, especially if the machine is ‘plumbed in’. If it is, ALWAYS turn off the water when the machine is not in
use. The water-intake valves could fail under constant pressure of mains water. If the waste pipe is hooked over a sink, ensure water in the
sink never covers the end of the pipe. Water could be syphoned back into the machine.

ALWAYS follow manufacturers’ instructions about safe loading and operation. If a violent wobbling takes place during spinning, switch off
the machine and try the last part of the programme (final rinse to spin) again to try to redistribute the load. If this doesn’t work, you
may have to let the machine ‘empty’ the water (on front loaders) and find a part of the cycle that will allow you to open the door.

:::danger[Warning]

When washing machines and tumbledryers are not in use, switch OFF. Children have been known to crawl in or put pets in. Several nasty
injuries and even deaths have occurred in tumbledryers-where a child has climbed inside and closed the door from the inside, thereby
starting the machine.

:::
If you use a lot of bleach in your machine regularly, the rubber seals may begin to degrade a lot sooner.

Using the wrong washing powder (using manual in automatics) can produce violent results, with more foam being produced than you or the machine
can handle. The safe operating of the machine may also be affected.

#### Cupboards and drawers

Some of the simplest mishaps can lead to worse accidents. As you are distracted by a minor misadventure, you are less able to react
efficiently to something else. A slip in the kitchen can bring you into contact with flame, hot liquids and sharp implements as well as sharp
corners and hard surfaces.

Fix stops on the inside of drawers to prevent them being pulled out too far and spilling their contents.

Get into the habit of ALWAYS shutting cupboard doors. Standing up from stooping or turning round, it is easy to catch against the door or
knock your head against the bottom edge-a nasty injury if it is metal!

#### Knives

Never put sharp knives into washing-up water with other items. It is easy to touch or grasp a blade unintentionally. Handle each knife
individually. Wash, wipe and put away, in a childproof place—not ‘on display’ where children (or even intruders) may misuse
them.

Pass knives with care! Hold the blade with the cutting edge AWAY from the palm or fingers and offer the handle to the other person. DON’T
walk about holding a knife.

ALWAYS cut away from yourself. A sharp knife cuts smoothly and is therefore less likely to inflict injury than a blunt one (which has to be
used with more pressure so cannot be halted as quickly).

NEVER use knives, or other cutlery, for tightening screws, removing bicycle tyres or other jobs. It will not only damage blades, but produce
burrs which could cause cuts if they catch against the hand or lips in normal use.

Sharpening a knife consists of wearing away some of the metal to produce a thin cutting edge. The traditional method is to hone it on a
whetstone and then finish the edge on a sharpening steel—a grooved metal rod. These techniques require practice to do them safely and
efficiently.

There are several other kinds of sharpener, some electrically-powered, which offer metal discs, small steels, tungsten cutters or ceramic
grinders to remove metal from both sides of the blade at once. In all cases, they operate by drawing the knife between the cutters. If they
are easy to keep stable, they are probably safer than a steel.

Accidents in sharpening knives usually occur when the sharpening device slips—not the knife, so choose the one you feel is solid and
stable.

Some individual knives also come with their own holster, which not only protects the blade when not in use but sharpens it each time it is
drawn in and out. They only sharpen that knife and cannot be used on others unless they exactly fit the holster.

Wash knives before sharpening—and afterwards clean both knife and sharpener to remove the small particles of metal which will still be
attached to them.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

It is well worth investing in a few good basic knives, instead of lots of gadgety ones. Good knives are usually of better steel, and honed
to a longer-lasting edge. Sometimes, good kitchen equipment shops may be able to recommend specialist companies who re-sharpen good knives
when the edge needs major work. Treat these good knives with care, and they could last for years.

:::

### LIVING ROOM

The majority of living room accidents involve tripping over something—so ensure there are no trailing cables from lamps and electrical
appliances, or small obstructions. Never leave things lying around on the floor. Teach children not to leave toys scattered about where they
or others could trip over them.

The living room is the area where there is most likely to be an open fire, a gas fire or an electric heater-whether or not the house is
centrally heated. Do not leave newspapers or fuel close to open fires.

#### Fit a fireguard

A sparkguard, consisting of a screen of fine wire mesh, should be placed round an open fire, whenever it is left unattended and especially
when you go out of the house or up to bed. An even better practice would be to rake the embers so that the fire goes out completely. The guard
should be anchored to the wall, and enclosed at the top, sides and front—if all sparks are to be safely contained.

:::info[CHILDPROOFING]

For a home with young children, a secure fireguard fixed to the wall is needed with any sort of fire—not just an open one. Children
must not only be kept away, but also prevented from poking things through into the flames or onto the electric element. An open mesh will
allow you to enjoy the full benefit of the fire, but closer mesh is needed for an efficient sparkguard.

Keep alcohol away from youngsters—do not leave drinks out on a table and always return the bottle to a secure cupboard or cabinet,
which should be locked before you leave the room. NEVER keep children’s drinks in the same place as alcohol—don’t tempt them
to help themselves.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

NEVER use fireguards for airing or drying clothes, nor hang things to dry above the grate. ENSURE that portable oil and gas heaters are on
a stable base and out of draughts. Follow the instructions already given. Never cover the ventilation grills of these or of any electric
fires. DON’T use an overmantel mirror for brushing hair, shaving or applying make-up. It is easy to get too close and, if wearing
loose clothes, to set yourself alight.

:::

#### Other fire hazards

Upholstered furniture often burns easily and foam, plastic and synthetic fabrics produce thick smoke and toxic gases. Modern furniture should
be fire resistant and tested to withstand a smouldering cigarettemand labelled so. Look for items that have also been tested as resistant to a
lighted match.

Candles can create a very cosy and romantic atmosphere, but use them with caution. People who are used to lighting their homes with oil lamps
and candles know how much heat is generated above them. Pass your hand above a naked candle flame and you will realize how carefully it must
be placed so that it cannot ignite anything overhead or nearby. Always set candles securely in holders with a firm base. NEVER put lighted
candles on top of a television set.

Cigarettes not only damage your health, they are a serious fire risk. Make sure all ashtrays are stable-the lidded kind that extinguish
cigarettes are best. Do not put sweet papers in them—they could ignite. Never balance ashtrays on the arms of chairs or place them in
the middle of a sofa seat. A fallen cigarette end could start a fire.

NEVER smoke in bed! However many times this advice is repeated, people still do it and start serious fires.
:::info[FIRE FACTS]

Some furnishings burn at a temperature of over 1000&deg;C (1832&deg;F), and produce deadly choking fumes and smoke. In some cases a whole
house has been engulfed in under TWO MINUTES ([see FIRE!](/sas-urban/urban-fire)).

Over twice as many people are asphyxiated by fumes and smoke, than are killed by the flames. Keeping low to the floor as you escape,
covering your mouth and nose, will help protect you from the worst effects. Apart from the smoke, heat and carbon monoxide
dangers—polyurethane foam gives off hydrogen cyanide when burnt. PVC gives off hydrogen chloride. Both are highly toxic. Note that
some foam furnishings may still be made of polyurethane foam. PVC is very common—even electrical cables are insulated with
it—and any appliance, especially a television, contains enough PVC to give off a roomful of fumes.

If a fire gets out of control-EVACUATE. Call the fire brigade.
:::

#### Television sets/computer screens

ALL electrical equipment should be given plenty of ventilation. Don’t block the air vents provided in the appliance.

Televisions involve many hazards. They operate using very high voltages—at least 20,000 volts for colour, 10,000 volts for
black-and-white. Their circuits take the main voltage and amplify it. These high voltages are still present for a while after the television
has been switched off. NEVER take the back off the set, or poke anything through the holes. NEVER place fish tanks, flower vases, potted
plants, drinks or any other liquids on top of or close to televisions. The danger of electrocution is very real and very serious.

#### TV/computer fires

Because of fire risks, televisions should be switched off at the mains and unplugged when not in use—not left on ‘standby’,
which is possible with some sets.

If you smell burning, or if you see smoke or flames, switch off at the mains immediately. If the TV is blocking your route to the socket,
switch off at the fuse box/consumer unit.

Use only a dry extinguisher or fire blanket—NEVER liquid extinguishers. A damp blanket (when the power is off) covering the entire set
should contain flames and some fumes-it may also help contain glass fragments in case the tube ‘explodes’ (actually implodes). Do NOT
approach the set from the front, because of the danger of flying glass fragments.

Evacuate because of the risk of highly toxic fumes, and ventilate the room as soon as the fire is fully extinguished. If there is any sign of
the fire getting out of control, evacuate and call the fire brigade.

:::

#### Children’s toys

Check all toys for sharp edges, finger traps or pieces which could be swallowed. Look especially for eyes on spikes in old soft toys. Do not
let small children play with anything small enough to become lodged in nose, ear or throat.

Lead paint was regularly used on old toys and young children should not be allowed to play with them, since they might put them in their
mouths or suck fingers which have picked up flakes of paint.

All toys for sale in shops have to pass stringent safety tests. This is particularly important with toys for young children. Beware cheap
imported toys (often seen in markets) which may evade the testing procedures.

Allow children to use only non-toxic paints and crayons—make sure they are so labelled. Many artists’ colours contain poisonous
chemicals which could be sucked from brush or hands [see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS: Artists’ paints](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards#other-crafts)).

KEEP TOYS TIDY! Make sure children have a cupboard or box in which to keep their toys and a shelf for their own books. Toys left lying around
are a common cause of falls-especially on stairs. Small round objects and wheeled toys are most dangerous, but anything lying on the stairs
could send you headlong down them.

### BEDROOM

The main fire risk in bedrooms is caused by people smoking in bed. Another common cause of fire is the electric blanket. Some mattresses are
now made of foam and risks are as serious as with foam-filled furniture in the living room. Toxic fumes given off during burning are a major
cause of loss of life ([see FIRE!](/sas-urban/urban-fire)). Nightclothes should be made of flame-retardant fabric.

The bedroom seems to be a room where people stumble around a lot in the dark—usually getting up in the night to go to the toilet.
DON’T leave shoes or clothing where they can be tripped over. DON’T leave drawers and doors open to be walked into. DON’T leave
trailing flexes around.

:::danger[Warning]

Don’t be tempted to drape a cloth or place a paper bag over a light to dim it. Use a low-wattage bulb, a dimmer switch or a
safety-approved nightlight.

:::

#### Electric blankets

Some new blankets have good thermostatic controls, or devices to prevent overheating. The more safety features, the better. Older electric
blankets may represent a serious hazard.

-   ALWAYS switch off before going to bed—unless a special type made to operate on extra-low voltage (ELV).
-   Have your electric blanket checked by the manufacturer if there is any sign of fraying, scorching, worn flex, loose connections or tie
    tapes damaged or missing—every year, even if nothing appears to be wrong. Do so in the summer when you don’t need to use the
    blanket.
-   NEVER use an electric overblanket as an underblanket or vice-versa.
-   ENSURE underblankets are flat and securely tied to mattress. Check regularly. NEVER secure with safety pins.
-   Do NOT use a hot-water bottle with an electric blanket.
-   NEVER use an electric blanket that is wet for any reason. Even if an electric blanket is only slightly wet, do not switch it on in an
    attempt to dry it out.
-   Roll rather than fold an electric blanket when in storage. Keep it on top of a pile so that it’s not squashed by other bedding or
    store as an extra blanket on a spare bed.

:::info[THE NURSERY]

-   Ensure cot mattresses fit well and leave no room at head or foot.
-   Cot bars should be not more than 6cm (2.5in) apart so that a child cannot trap its head.
-   Baby bumpers (to keep child from banging against rails) are not really necessary. If you use them, ensure ties are as short as
    possible—use a double knot and trim off the ends.
-   Babies under 12 months old should NOT have pillows.
-   Lie babies on their side or front. On their backs, if they are sick, it is possible that they may choke.
-   Do not leave babies to sleep in quilted bag ‘baby nests’ all night.
-   Use anti-burglar window catches to prevent children opening windows and falling out. Alternatively fit bars or railings, at least
    until the child is old enough to understand the dangers.
-   Audio baby alarms are essential to detect any problems that may occur—and to avoid you constantly looking in to check the infant
    is all right. Video (CCTV) versions are also available. It’s worth using these until the child is at least four, especially during
    periods of illness.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Some pillows and duvets/eiderdowns are washable or may be dry cleaned. If dry cleaning is preferred, take the item to a
specialist—not a do-it-yourself dry cleaners. After dry cleaning, the bedding MUST be properly aired to prevent the residual
poisonous fumes from the cleaning fluid making you very ill—possibly causing lung and eye irritation, possibly death in infants.

:::

### BATHROOM

Electricity and water are an extremely dangerous combination. In the bathroom there is a lot of well-earthed metal. When you become wet,
especially in the bath or shower, you become an excellent conductor. There should be:

-   NO ordinary sockets in the bathroom.
-   NO ordinary switches—unless the pull-cord type.
-   NO way to touch any electrical appliances from the bath.
-   NO portable electrical equipment in bathrooms.

The light should be operated, if not by a pull-cord switch, then by a switch OUTSIDE the bathroom altogether. NEVER switch it on or off with
wet hands. The same applies to overmirror lights and heaters. Light fittings should be fully enclosed to avoid the risk of dense steam or
water splashes reaching them.

Electric showers should only be fitted by an expert, and protected by an RCD/RCB/ELCB ([see Electricity)](#electricity).

NEVER take any mains-operated appliance, not even a radio or hairdryer, into the bathroom on an extension lead. NEVER NEVER NEVER allow
anything like this near the bath when you are in it!

If you have to use power tools in the bathroom, make sure you use an RCD/RCB/ELCB.

#### The bath

Falls in the bath account for one third of bathroom accidents. DON’T stand in the bath, especially not when drying yourself. People tend
to stand on one foot, resting the other on the side of the bath. One slip is all it takes!

If you must stand in the bath, because the shower is there perhaps, use a non-slip rubber bath mat. Fit grab handles using solid
fixings—a grab handle attached to a hollow plasterboard wall may come away in your hand. The same goes for anything else you may clutch
at when falling, although slipping in the bath is like slipping on ice. You don’t realize what is happening until you land! If you need to
fix to a hollow wall, screw into the wooden batons behind the plasterboard.

Test water temperature before getting into the bath. It shouldn’t emerge from the taps at nearly boiling point-although many people seem
to adjust hot-water cylinder thermostats until this happens. It should not be necessary to set the thermostat much above 64&deg;C (147&deg;F).

Avoid highly polished floor surfaces, and mop up any spills. Don’t splash water around. Check that the shower and splashed bathwater
don’t regularly run down walls or trickle down onto the floor. Small leaks can do more damage than big ones. If you have let the bath
overflow, it could be serious enough to bring down a ceiling in the room below. Small leaks on a regular basis could be just as serious.

:::info[BATHROOM ROT]

The conditions around the shower, bath and toilet, bidet and washbasin are ideal for producing rot in timbers. This room could be the site
for the beginning of a devastating problem. Avoid constant leaks, puddles and splashes—avoid rot ([see Damp](#damp)).

:::

If condensation is a problem, fit a good extractor fan. If no outside wall is available, it may be necessary to fit ducting to expel the
unwanted moisture. The trouble involved in fitting an extractor could be preferable to having to deal with rot and mould later.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If running a bath steams up your bathroom excessively, the problem could be partly solved by warming the air in the bathroom. Warmer air
can hold more moisture without producing condensation. Running some cold water into the bath first, followed by hot—piped UNDER this
cold water with a shower attachment—will also help cut down on steam.

:::

#### Sealants

Check round the wall edges of your bath, shower cubicle and washbasin. There should be a good seal, to avoid water constantly trickling down.
It may seem unimportant, but a regular trickle could do great damage to ceilings and electrical fittings below—quite apart from the
possibility of rot ([see BATHROOM ROT](#the-bath)). A long-lasting seal is possible with correctly applied silicon sealant
(available in a range of colours). If the gap is wide, it may be necessary to span it with a plastic strip fixed with the same sealant.

#### Bathroom glass

If a bath is beside a window, ensure that the window is fitted with safety glass to prevent a serious accident. Use safety glass for shower
screens and mirrors ([see Common accidents](#common-accidents)).

Do not leave parabolic shaving or make-up mirrors on window ledges, especially if there are net curtains at the window. Sunlight focused by
the mirror could set fire to the net or any other inflammables on which the beam is concentrated.

#### Showers

If other taps are turned on in the house you may find shower water temperature suddenly changing. Cold water may be a shock, but hot could
scald. Installing thermostatic flow controls should reduce the risk.

Instant showers, in which the water is heated as it is drawn (rather than coming from a hot-water storage cylinder) are of high wattage and
require a separate circuit protected by an RCD/RCB/ELCB. They activate when the water is turned on, but should also have a separate on-off
switch which should be cord-operated or outside the bathroom. Don’t place the shower head where it will spray the control unit but put the
unit to the side away from the main jet.

:::danger[Warning]

DON’T mix toilet cleaners. Various combinations of toilet cleaner can react violently with one another. In some cases this results in
the production of highly toxic fumes which-it they don’t knock you out altogether-may produce uncontrollable choking and lung
irritation.

:::

:::info[CHILDPROOFING]

-   The bathroom is usually the one room that can be locked. Small children can often close a sliding bolt, but have some difficulty
    unlocking it. Set it out of reach of tiny hands.
-   If the door has an ordinary lock, remove the key and fit a bolt higher up. Don’t use too strong a bolt. If an accident happens,
    you may need to break the door down.
-   Make the medicine cabinet lockable and keep it locked. Hide the key. Children can otherwise investigate it at their leisure.
-   Similarly, lock up toilet cleaners and other chemicals or keep them out of children’s reach.
-   Some small children like to investigate toilets. Not very hygienic, but not likely to do serious harm—unless a toilet cleaner
    has been used. Use cleaners only after children have gone to bed.
-   Children are particularly likely to get into a bath without realizing that the water is too hot.
-   Non-slip mats and baby supports can make bathing easier and safer.
-   Never ever go away to answer the door or the phone leaving young children in the bath. Either ignore the caller or wrap the child in a
    towel and carry them with you.
-   Childproof medicine containers may NOT be childproof to a really deter-mined child. Treading on plastic containers may release the
    contents.

:::

### HALLWAY /STAIRS /LANDING

A huge number of reported home accidents involve injury to the feet. You should have a pair of slippers-not wander round in bare feet or only
wearing socks or stockings. Also, although you may become ‘attached’ to your favourite old slippers, you must replace them as soon as
they become worn or slippery.

:::danger[Warning]

When dealing with polished floors, particularly polished stairs, try to keep the use of waxes to a minimum. There are ‘non-slip’
waxes available which are not the total answer. The biggest danger comes from over-use of ‘silicone wax’ furniture polishes. The
silicone reduces friction, making furniture feel ‘polished’. Even the spray-drift off the edge of a table could cause a dangerous
slippery patch on the floor. Don’t polish handrails, where a good grip may be needed.

:::

-   Stairs are a particularly risky place for falls, each step can deliver an injury as you come down. Check the stairs themselves for
    structural soundness, rot and woodworm.
-   Check that lighting is effective and never put off changing light bulbs. Two-way switches or timed switches will help ensure that stairs
    do not have to be negotiated in the dark.
-   Keep carpets well fitted and in good repair.
-   Avoid loose rugs in halls.
-   Avoid placing furniture, plants, bicycles or any obstruction at the foot of stairs and on landings.
-   Fit a secure handrail the full length of the stairs and on each flight. If there are elderly members of the household, fit a rail up BOTH
    sides. Continue them onto the landings.
-   NEVER put things down on the stairs-dustpan and brushes, books, trays, clothes to be put in drawers, towels for the bathrooms, the vacuum
    cleaner with its flex. It seems the obvious place to put something to remind you to carry it up when next you go upstairs, but by then
    someone may have tripped on it—yourself, if you forget to pick it up!
-   Open risers can look attractive, but can be a hazard for the elderly and children. Consider boarding up the gaps until children are old
    enough not to stick their heads through.
-   Windows or glass doors opening from stairs should be glazed with toughened glass. Avoid having windows/glass doors at the foot of the
    stairs.

#### Fire risks

Do not store flammable materials such as old newspapers, oil-based paint, paraffin, or gas cylinders in a cupboard under the stairs. A fire
starting here will spread rapidly, the stairs acting as a chimney, taking the fire to the rest of the house.

Keep doors leading off halls and landings closed. This will slow down the spread of fire.
:::info[CHILDPROOFING]

Fit gates at top and bottom of the stairs, and at the bottom of the upward flight if there is another floor above the children’s
rooms. Gates should be easily removable (by adults) in case of fire or another emergency.

If balusters (vertical handrail supports) are more than 6cm (2.5ins) apart or there are climbable horizontal rails, board them over until
small children have grown old enough to make the risks negligible.

Discourage children from sliding on banisters or playing on stairs and in hallways. Teach them never to leave toys, books, schoolbags or
any other objects on stairs or in hallways.

:::

### LOFT

Use a proper ladder or stepladder to get into your loft, and make sure that it is firm and stable before climbing it. For a long-term
solution, fit a proper loft ladder that can be folded up and pulled down as required.

Take up a torch with you, or an inspection light in a wire cage—never a naked flame. In the long term extend the lighting circuit to the
loft, it will make inspections very much easier and help prevent freeze-ups in cold climates. Fit the switch on the landing below so that you
do not have to climb into the dark.

Loft entry covers are often unattached boards. Move them gently so that they do not crash back. Fitting hinges, plus a block to support them
when open, will avoid this problem—but ensure that they open in a direction which will not obstruct your access. Concertina, folding and
sliding ladders are all available ready made, sometimes complete with a built-in hatch cover. These covers often open downwards.

#### Access and storage

Lofts are not built as rooms, but as air spaces beneath the roof and to house water tanks. They may have no floorboards and if you step off
the rafters you will probably go straight through the ceiling into the room below. Fix strong boards across the rafters to give you easy
access in places you may need to reach. Do NOT use loose boarding.

Consider putting a proper floor down. In most cases the joists, where you would fix floorboards, are not load-bearing. The floors below have
stronger joists to take the loads necessary. In the loft, the joists were only intended to support the ceiling immediately below. That means
that if you’re considering conversion of the loft-space into a room, this is one of the first problems that needs to be solved.

Although not intended as storage areas, that is how many lofts get used. Lay boards across the joists, to spread the load, wherever you want
to place objects. DON’T balance boxes on joists or rest anything directly on the ‘ceiling’ between the joists—they could end
up in the room below!

Do not store heavy objects over the centre of large rooms-it could cause ceilings to sag. Place heavy furniture against the outside walls and
the party walls of terrace and semidetached houses where the load will be more readily transferred to the walls—but take care not to add
too much weight!

Do not fill the loft with inflammable material. A fire could become established there without you being aware of it below.

#### Insulation

Check that water tanks and pipes are properly lagged. If the loft is insulated with mineral-fibre blanket, wear gloves and a dust mask if you
are likely to disturb it to prevent irritation to skin, lungs and mucous membranes. Insulation is economically and ecologically desirable, but
the roof must be ventilated to avoid the risk of condensation in an unheated roof space.

Modern houses often have ventilation holes at the eaves which may become blocked with insulation. You may need to insert airbricks in the
gables or drill holes in the soffit boards. Do not insulate over electric cables since they could overheat. Do not insulate under water
tanks—warmth from the lower floors helps to prevent freezing.

:::info[MIND YOUR HEAD]

Are there low doorways, beams, shelves and cupboards which could deliver a nasty bump to the head? Don’t put shelves and cupboards
where this can happen, especially if the stairs are involved.

If there is an overhead obstruction as you come down the stairs (more likely in an older property), you may have to pad it to prevent
people from having a nasty accident. Otherwise you could paint it to highlight the danger, or pin a strip of fabric across so that people
duck slightly lower than they would have to normally.

:::

### GARDEN

The garden can be a real danger zone-especially for children, Who should be able to play there unsupervised. Make sure paths and steps are
safe and even. If they become slippery With moss or choked with Weeds, they could become dangerous. Ice and snow should be cleared and a thin
layer of sharp sand/ grit should be laid in frosty Weather. A sand-and-salt mixture will clear thin ice and snow, if you don’t mind the
salt running off into flowerbeds.

The gate (if there is one) should be strong enough to deter a young child from running out into the road. Keep the catch high enough or
difficult enough to discourage tiny fingers.

#### Garden chemicals

Chemical pesticide sprays, slug pellets and similar products are developed to kill. Few of them are selective—they will also do harm to
your pets, your children and yourself if ingested, inhaled or absorbed ([see POISONS](/sas-urban/urban-poison)).

Long before [pesticides](/sas-urban/urban-poison#pesticides) were developed by the petrochemicals industry, there were effective organic ways
of dealing with most of our garden pests. Plants that were not dosed with artificial fertilizers and sprays were stronger and more resistant
to pests and diseases. Investigate organic gardening and you remove much of the danger from your own garden.

If you MUST use [pesticides](/sas-urban/urban-poison#pesticides), take care not to breathe in the spray/mist yourself. You should wear a face
mask to help avoid inhalation, goggles for your eyes and gloves to prevent skin contact—at the very least.

Keep the poison well away from garden ponds with fish, frogs or other useful animals in them and from any other animals in the
garden—whether pet tortoises or friendly visitors. Unfortunately there is little you can do to protect birds. If they eat the slugs that
eat your pellets or the flies you spray with insecticide, the poisons will be passed on through the food chain even if not by direct contact.
Keep children, adults and animals out of the garden after spraying.

Do not overuse poisons. Most of the weedkillers and insecticides in common use today are extremely potent, designed for impatient gardeners.

#### Bonfires

Bonfires are frequently forbidden in urban areas because of air pollution and fire hazards. Composting is the easiest way of disposing of
garden waste—providing a useful extra for the flower beds. If fires are permitted keep them well away from trees and fences. Avoid any
possibility that the house, garage or shed could be endangered if the fire should get out of control. NEVER throw fuel on if the fire
isn’t burning as fast as you would like. Do not light them with petrol or paraffin. Build them properly and they will burn with ease
[see FIRE!](/sas-urban/urban-fire)).

Avoid large unstable bonfires. If you have a lot to burn, don’t make one massive pile and then set light to it! Have a medium-sized
controllable fire, which you can add to gradually as it burns down. Start with newspaper, kindling and fire lighters to get the fire going.

Incinerators will contain a small fire. If you buy one, read the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. ALWAYS keep a bucket of water, a
fire extinguisher or fire-beater handy when having a bonfire OR a barbecue.

:::danger[Warning]

Do not burn rubber or plastics. The fumes may be deadly. DON’T inhale too much smoke, even without fumes it contains CARBON MONOXIDE.
NEVER put aerosols on the fire-they could blow up. Only build a fire on earth-never tarmac, and never concrete or stone which might
explode.

:::

:::info[CHILDPROOFING]

-   Make sure fences are secure and gates lockable, so that children cannot go out or squeeze through by themselves.
-   Garden ponds and swimming pools should be fenced off if young children are allowed in a garden unsupervised. In some countries they
    must be fenced by law. Consider filling in ponds with earth until children are older
-   Water butts should be kept covered.
-   Empty paddling pools after use and do not let children play in them unsupervised. A plastic pool left out in the rain can rapidly fill
    to a couple of inches—quite enough for a small child to drown in, if they fall face down.
-   Teach children not to eat any part of plants or to suck their fingers after touching them (for poisonous plants, see
    [here](/sas-urban/urban-poison#poisonous-plants)). Bought seeds may have been coated with toxic chemicals to make them keep.
-   Keep sand pits covered when not in use—this will keep out rainwater and mess from any visiting cats or dogs.
-   Site swings and play equipment on or over grass, not on hard surfaces.
-   Do not let children play near greenhouses, garden frames or any structures which have glass panes.
-   Don’t let children use garden tools. Always keep children away when you are mowing the lawn.

:::

#### In the garden:

-   Make sure your gardening footwear is sturdy enough to withstand crushing—or piercing from above or below.
-   Use each tool for the job it was intended to do.
-   Clean and oil tools after use.
-   Don’t use tools with loose or ‘bodged’ handles.
-   Put away all tools after use, especially if there are children or pets about.
-   Wear gloves—don’t handle soil excessively.
-   Always wash your hands, when you finish gardening.
-   Avoid hand-to-mouth contact—which includes smoking, eating or drinking.
-   Check when hedge-trimming that there are no hidden posts, wires—or birds’ nests.
-   Avoid lifting heavy weights which are a strain.

:::danger[Warning]

DON’T attempt major work on trees, especially if you have to climb to do so. Get professional advice-to avoid injury and making a tree
unsafe.

:::

#### Electricity in the garden

Most accidents happen (and most fatalities are caused) when using electric lawnmowers and hedgetrimmers. You MUST protect yourself with an
RCD/RCB/ELCB ([see Electricity](#electricity)). In most cases it’s a good idea to drape the flex from an appliance over your
shoulder to keep it out of harm’s way.

DON’T wander about with electrical mowers. Try to mow in more-or-less straight lines or with some sort of method—not up and down
slopes, but along them. That way you stand less chance of ‘mowing’ the cable or your feet, than you do using the mower like a vacuum
cleaner!

Extension cables are only temporary solutions. You should choose ones designed for outdoor use—with rubber fittings for extra protection
against breakage and moisture. Coiled extension cable MUST be fully unwound before use, to prevent overheating and the possibility of fire.

ALWAYS connect the extension to the appliance FIRST, then—making sure the appliance is switched off make the connection at the mains
socket and switch on. Don’t switch on the appliance until you have reached the place where you intend to start working. When you have
finished, ALWAYS switch off the appliance, then go to the main socket and switch it off and pull out the plug. Then you can remove the
extension cable from the appliance.

NEVER ‘tinker’ with electrical appliances when they are plugged in. NEVER use electrical tools if it’s raining or the ground is
wet/damp. NEVER clean or adjust blades of mowers or hedgetrimmers while the power is switched on—it’s a risk that’s just not
worth taking.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

It is possible to have special outdoor sockets fitted, to avoid the need for long extension cables trailed from inside the house ([see Electricity](#electricity)). You may not see a cable in long grass?

:::

:::danger[Warning]

ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS wear thick rubber boots when using electrical equipment in the garden. NEVER use electrical tools when it’s
raining or the ground is wet/damp.

:::

### GARAGE/SHED

In a perfect world, garages and sheds would be tidy and safe with a place for everything. Some garages have to be a toolshed, a gardening shed
and a storage area for household overspill all rolled into one—sometimes there is no room for the car!

DON’T clutter up the garage or shed. You’ll trip over things or hurt yourself sifting through everything.

#### Chemicals

All chemicals should either be stored high up, or locked up. Most garages/sheds are not insulated—check that the chemicals can tolerate
heat or freezing conditions. Don’t store chemicals on the hottest side of the shed. NEVER store them in direct sunlight. Check packets,
bottles and cans for signs of leakage, damp and rust from time to time.

NEVER store chemicals where a child could reach them. Either ban children from the garage/shed altogether, or be prepared to lock up the
chemicals. Some of the more dangerous household chemicals could be stored in the garage/shed—oven cleaners, caustic soda, acids,
solvents etc. But remember the possibility of frost or heat damage.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Don’t store large quantities of petrol, paraffin, turpentine (or substitute) or any other flammable substances. In some countries,
including Britain, there are legal limits to the amount of petrol you are allowed to store.

:::

#### Lighting

If you intend to work in the garage/shed, good lighting is essential. Either have the bench under the window, or consider running power to the
outbuilding ([see Electricity](#electricity)). If you use gas or oil lamps, take extra care. Keep them well away from wood
shavings, sawdust, rags and all chemicals/fuel, on a stable surface. NEVER work in a bad light with power tools.

#### Storage

If you’ve got rafters or enough headroom, you could build a safe storage area to keep things out of the way. DON’T balance objects on
overhead beams, though—unless you want boxes to fall on your head! People often store lengths of timber, pipe and conduit by laying them
across the open rafters—usually because they’re too long to stack against a wall. Sooner or later, the ends of these droop
down—and cause very nasty accidents.

:::info[ANYTHING GOES?]

Try to think of your garage/shed as another room in your house—especially if you intend to spend any length of time in there. So
often ‘dodgy’ household appliances such as outdated light fittings and portable heaters are relegated to the garage/shed—and
used as if safety were no longer important.

People who would never tackle household electrical work often try to instal sockets and extension cables, breaking all the ‘rules’
in the process. ELECTROCUTION can be fatal ([see Electricity](#electricity)).

:::

#### Tools/garden tools

Most garden tools could inflict quite an injury if stepped on or tripped over. It’s best to have stout reliable hooks screwed into the
wall (or into a baton on the wall). Have the business ends where you won’t brush against them—or, worse still, get them in the face.
Above head height would be a good idea—but not so high that they could fall on you.

If you care about your woodworking tools, you probably store them safely. A toolbox is a good investment and saves time looking for
‘lost’ equipment. Don’t search through piles of tools and risk cutting your fingers on knives or chisels.

Pick up nails, screws and small fittings WHEN YOU DROP THEM—they could easily go through a shoe. Don’t store reusable wood with
nails sticking out of it. Pull them out. If you really haven’t time, it’s better to drive them in.

Clear up shavings soon after work has finished-or during working, if there’s a lot. One spark could start a fire.
:::danger[Warning]

Don’t let children ploy with bench-mounted vices. With some kinds, if they are unscrewed too far, the winding gear and half the vice
could full off-possibly onto someone’s toes.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

A first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher are a good idea if you intend to work in the garage/shed.
:::

:::info[IF YOU DO CAR REPAIRS]

-   NEVER run a car engine in a closed garage. The exhaust fumes may kill you ([see Carbon monoxide](#carbon-monoxide)).
-   ALWAYS use axle stands while working on a jacked-up car.
-   If there is an inspection pit, take care! Pits often don’t have drainage and could easily become waterlogged.
-   NEVER use electrical equipment while standing on wet ground!
-   Drain the pit regularly and don’t let debris, spilt fuel and oil accumulate in the bottom.
-   Put duckboarding or a wooden pallet in the bottom to stand on.
-   Keep the pit covered when the car is not over it, to avoid anyone falling in.
-   Oil on the floor could cause someone to slip over. Shake sand or sawdust on the spillage, wait a while and then sweep it up.
-   Watch out for fuel leaks from cars in the garage. A very slight leak might get worse. If you smell strong petrol fumes—remember,
    petrol vapour is heavy and will be denser nearer the floor (especially in a pit)—DON’T SMOKE. DON’T turn light switches
    on or off-it could cause a spark. Ventilate the area immediately.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

If you keep your freezer in the garage, it may produce a tiny spark when the cooling mechanism switches on and off. There is evidence that
this is enough to ignite a spillage of petrol or dense vapour—causing a very serious fire or explosion.

:::

## **LEAVING THE HOUSE**

:::info[BEDTIME CHECK LIST]

You should make a nightly, room-by-room check, before retiring, to make sure that all is safe and secure:

-   Turn off all gas and oil appliances, except for pilot-lights
-   Extinguish all fires, naked flames and cigarettes—DOUBLE CHECK!
-   Unplug electrical appliances—especially televisions
-   Make sure there are no obstructions on stairs or in passageways
-   Check everyone is home before securing entrance door bolts or locks which cannot be opened from outside
-   Lock all external doors and secure all windows in unoccupied rooms
-   Set any alarms

:::

### OUT FOR THE DAY

If leaving the home for the day, there are several safety and security considerations, which should become automatic. If necessary, make your
own check list.

-   Gas, oil and electrical appliances, such as central heating systems, may be left so long as they are working efficiently on a self-timer
    programme.
-   If you have automatic air-conditioning, follow the instructions regarding leaving the system for any length of time.
-   Extinguish portable gas and oil fires.
-   Either extinguish open fires, or allow to burn very low if protected by an efficient fireguard.
-   If anyone in the house smokes, check there are no cigarettes left burning in ashtrays or waste bins.
-   Unplug all electrical appliances-especially televisions.
-   Close all internal doors.
-   Lock all windows.
-   Check you have switched off any appliances you have been using-the oven or iron for instance.
-   Set lights on timers to ‘come on’ as if the house is occupied.
-   Lock garage and make sure contents are secure.
-   Check that no ladders are usable and tools are locked away.
-   Set alarms.
-   Set telephone answering machine.
-   Make provision for pets.
-   If car is in driveway, ensure all doors are locked.
-   Do not leave a key in ANY hiding place—however ‘clever’ or ‘safe’ you think it is.
-   Lock doors as you leave.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

When leaving a recorded message on a telephone answering machine, try to invent something which does not say, ‘We are not here at the
moment’. Phrases like: ‘We cannot come to the phone at the moment’ leave a certain vagueness as to whether the house is
occupied or not.

:::

### GOING AWAY

If leaving the house for longer than a day—say, a week or two for a holiday—there are other points to consider.

In warmer weather, central heating/hot water systems should be completely shut down. In colder weather, especially when there is a possibility
of water pipes freezing, set the thermostat to a low position. In this way, the central heating will only be activated when room temperatures
become very low. Hot water in a lagged cylinder will stay fairly warm, so the boiler will only need to fire up briefly to keep it hot. Turn
down the thermostat on the hot water cylinder to be safe. Electric immersion heaters MUST be switched off.

All electrical appliances should be switched off and unplugged—except for those lights activated by timer switches. Try to arrange
lights to operate in a realistic pattern at likely times of the day.

In the morning and afternoon the kitchen would normally be occupied. In the evening the living and sleeping areas are normally in use.
DON’T just have a hallway light showing. Some timers allow you to programme several on/off periods so that you can vary the sequence. An
observant burglar keeping watch over several nights might notice repeating patterns.

If you are in doubt about the safety of your water system, turn off stopcocks and partially drain down large cisterns (indirect systems). Only
do so AFTER you have switched off water-filled central heating systems and immersion heaters.

It’s up to you to make adequate provision for pets and plants. A trusted neighbour may be able to help you out and-although you should
stop any regular deliveries to your home—they can make sure no unexpected parcels are left on your doorstep.

Tell at least one neighbour you have gone and leave a key with them. It could be an idea to tell the police in case the worst happens. Let
them know who has the key. A neighbour should know how to switch your alarm on and off. Lock garages/sheds to prevent access to tools which
might be used to gain entry.

### PETS

 

Although much good can come from owning pets, there are serious diseases/disorders which can be transmitted from pets to humans ([see HEALTH](/sas-urban/urban-health)).
There are also major safety considerations, which are outlined below. Remember that you can be legally as well as morally responsible for
your pet’s actions. If your dog bites a neighbour’s child or runs in front of a car and causes an accident, you could be sued for
compensation.

#### General hygiene

-   A pet should have its own bowls, utensils, can-opener, washing and mopping-up equipment.
-   Keep the area where the animal is fed, or where it regularly sleeps, clean. Vacuum and scrub surfaces as necessary.
-   Regularly wash or discard bedding.
-   Cat litter should be emptied regularly. There are health risks to humans, with severe health risks to a pregnant woman and her foetus.
-   Never allow an animal to lick your face, or the faces of children. NEVER!
-   If your pet has diarrhoea, be scrupulous about cleaning up-but wear gloves and wash afterwards. There could be a danger of
    cross-infection.
-   DON’T allow children—especially toddlers-to play on the ground where dogs regularly defecate. There are severe health risks.
-   Don’t garden or work with soil without gloves. If you do, wash thoroughly afterwards.
-   Bird keepers should be scrupulous about cleaning out cages. Do it outside or keep people away. Wear breathing protection—to avoid
    inhaling dust from feathers or debris. There is a serious health risk.

#### General safety

-   Keep pets away while you are cooking—both for hygiene and the possibility of nasty accidents.
-   Remember: Animals under your feet can cause a serious fall, especially on the stairs. Pets cause a lot of accidents to children and the
    elderly.
-   Don’t allow a child to boisterously handle a pet—especially if the animal belongs to someone else. Even animals have
    tempers—and may retaliate.
-   Make sure your fence/gate is secure to prevent your dog running free.
-   Legally you may be responsible if your dog causes distress, damage to property, or an accident.
-   You may have to consider a muzzle on large dogs, especially guard dogs which are also pets. This may be a legal requirement in some
    countries.
-   If you have an exotic or dangerous pet, especially a snake, you can be responsible for injuries it may cause.
-   Don’t allow your dog to chase pedestrians, cyclists and cars.
-   Take care when a bitch has a litter to protect. She may be overly-defensive and snap at strangers and children.

:::info[AQUARIA]

What could be more harmless than a colourful aquarium full of fish? But BEWARE—many of them are carnivores and some have vicious
teeth! A moray eel, for instance, may rise out of the water and literally bite the hand that feeds it. Other species may be highly
venomous-make sure you KNOW the potential hazards-don’t just guess!

Fish aquaria pose serious electrical risks. If you can use appliances which operate on reduced voltages, do so. Since most tanks have to
have heaters and pumps, keep fuses to 3 amps. Switch off everything before touching the water, and DON’T touch electrical fittings
with wet hands. DON’T bodge wiring jobs-you AND your fish may be fried!

:::

### UNUSUAL PETS

It is illegal to keep some animals—often a country’s own indigenous species. Trade in many endangered species is prohibited by
international agreement, so they cannot be exported/imported as this often leads to extreme cruelty or infringement of quarantine laws. It is
only thanks to such legislation that Britain and other countries have managed to more-or-less eradicate rabies and other serious diseases
[see SELF-DEFENCE: Animal attack](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#animal-attack) and [HEALTH: Zoonoses](/sas-urban/urban-health#zoonoses)). Ownership
of some animals is prohibited because they are poisonous or otherwise dangerous. To obtain a licence to keep them, it is necessary to show
that they will be kept securely with no risk to the public.

In Britain a licence is needed to keep a poisonous snake, but a tarantula or a boa constrictor can be kept without infringing the law.
However, it is obvious that they must be housed so that they cannot roam free or pose any risk to others. Owners must know how to handle them
and the animals may come to recognize such handling. DO NOT encourage visitors to handle them without supervision and instruction—you
could be held responsible if any mishap occurred.
