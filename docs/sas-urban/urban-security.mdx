No one wants to live or work in a fortress, but you must protect yourself from the risk of attack by intruders. Thieves and vandals seem to be
more daring than ever—you’ll have to do more than fit locks to keep them out.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img139_001.jpg" />

## **SAFE & SECURE**

Intrusion, break-ins, theft and vandalism may not be life-threatening in themselves—but they cause an enormous amount of stress. Your home,
where you normally feel safe, can be rendered uninhabitable in minutes. The fact that ANYONE has entered your property by force can be very
traumatic. Burglars could wreck a home—or empty it? At the very worst, you may be injured or even murdered by intruders. At work, apart from
the loss of valuable equipment and man-hours, priceless data may be destroyed if computer systems are sabotaged. Competitors may take extreme
measures to secure highly valuable information.

Insurance policies may cover basic replacement of stolen or damaged property, but money cannot replace possessions of great sentimental value or
the time spent decorating and furnishing your home. At work, it may be even more difficult to assess the extent of the damage done, including the
loss of business advantages.

Many burglaries involve only petty theft. At home this may mean that ‘casual’ thieves are only looking for televisions and video
recorders, cash and small valuables. At work ‘casual’ thieves may be more interested in cashboxes and employees’ personal possessions.
Many ‘professional’ thieves aim for higher stakes—they know where there are things worth stealing and times when they can be stolen.

Take action to counter the threat of intrusion and all the damage that may be done as a result. You MUST realize that there is more to safety and
security than just fitting efficient locks.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

The number of break-ins to homes and offices every week is huge—and steadily increasing. In many cases, unless there is physical attack,
arson or something very valuable has been stolen, there is little the police can do. Fingerprinting (when it takes place at all) does more to
reassure you that something is being done. Tell the police if you have marked your possessions in any way, provide photographs of valuables
and any information which may assist them in the recognition or recovery of your possessions.

:::warning[EMERGENCY!]
BURGLED!

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img140_002.jpg" />

If you arrive at your home/work and have reason to suspect that A BURGLARY IS TAKING PLACE

**DO NOT GO IN**

If you think that intruders may still be inside, call the police and find a safe vantage point—outside or at a neighbour’s. You may
see the thieves leaving. Be ready to jot down descriptions of people/vehicles

Do NOT attempt to apprehend the thieves

**IF YOU ARRIVE ON FOOT**

Walk on. If you have already reached the door, turn round and get away as fast as possible

**IF YOU ARRIVE BY CAR**

Drive on. Park where you will be safe, call the police and keep an eye on the property. If you have already pulled into a driveway, pretend
you were using it to turn the car round. Back out and drive off

**IF YOU DISTURB INTRUDERS**

GET OUT! Do NOT call out. Do NOT block likely exit routes

If you arrive at your home/work and have reason to suspect that A BURGLARY HAS TAKEN PLACE

**DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING**

If the thieves have left, call the police. While you wait, start a visual search to ascertain what is missing. If distressed or unable to cope
, alone, call a friend to be with you, go to a neighbour’s or wait outside for the police to arrive

**If you hear intruders at night**

Do NOT leave the room. Do not attempt to apprehend the thief. Look for something to defend yourself with. If you have a bedside telephone,
call the police immediately. If not, wait until the intruder has left. Move about noisily, turn lights on and hold a conversation. If you are
alone, pretend to be talking to a male companion

:::

## **HOME SECURITY**

Ground floor and basement properties are the most vulnerable. Detached houses, especially when set well back from the road and screened by walls,
fences, trees and bushes, are easy targets. They may suggest a wealthier lifestyle and more valuables—it is also less likely that the
burglar will be observed by neighbours or passers-by. Properties backing on to wasteland, alleyways, public parks and other routes allowing easy
access (and getaway!) have a greater risk of burglary. An adjacent building site or scaffolding makes a house particularly vulnerable.

You don’t have to be wealthy to be burgled! Most homes have a television, stereo, video equipment or other electrical items-all relatively
easy to dispose of. Small items such as cash, cameras, watches, medals and jewellery may be slipped into pockets—an important consideration
if you have to leave a house by climbing out of an upstairs window!

You can improve the security of the site where you live and also make the house itself more difficult to break into. Security is also an important
consideration when looking for a new home—knowing some of the high-risk factors could be one of the influences in your choice.

#### Visibility

Balance your need for privacy against that for security. Fences, shrubbery and trees screening your home will all give intruders cover. Keep
hedges low so that the entrances to your home can be seen over them—thorny ones may help to deter people from trying to break through them.

Garden walls and fences are less easy to climb if they have trelliswork mounted on top of them. Make it too high and too frail to be climbed. This
won’t keep out a determined burglar but will deter the opportunist. Such protection is only effective if there are no sections of the
perimeter where a wall, roof or other solid structure allows easy access or a weak gate provides entry at ground level.

Outdoor illumination of your home should be designed to expose anyone lurking—‘decorative’ garden lighting may offer more hiding
places in shadows. A light above or beside a door will show up anyone trying to force locks or break the door open. It will also allow you to see
people at night through your security peephole.

A timer or a light-sensitive switch (which is activated when daylight fades) will turn lights on when no one is at home. A better idea for a porch
light is to use an infra-red movement detector, which is activated when anyone approaches—a welcome for friendly visitors and an immediate
deterrent to someone who does not wish to be seen. The impression given as you step into the field of the detector is that someone has heard you
and switched a light on.

#### Keeping intruders out

Check ALL possible means of entry. Do they have secure locks? The smallest window (in a bathroom or over a doorway, perhaps) may be big enough for
a person to wriggle through. Skylights and upper windows are vulnerable if a ladder is used or if there is access from the roof of another part of
the building—or even from another building. Even a coal hole or delivery chute may be big enough for a child, if not for an adult. In old
houses even chimneys may allow access. Chimney-sweeps’ boys used to climb inside them!

When deciding priorities, deal with the ground floor first, then any upper windows near flat roofs, beside a drainpipe or otherwise more
accessible. On wood-framed windows you can improvise temporary security measures in a few minutes, by inserting screws to prevent latches, catches
and staybars from being used.

A temporary measure, if you have sash windows, is to drill a hole through the inner sash and into the outer to hold a screw to prevent the window
from being opened. Casement window catches and staybars can also be temporarily immobilized by inserting a screw.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img141_002.jpg" />

Windows could be firmly screwed shut, but this is inadvisable if the window needs to be used as a fire escape.

:::info[DANGER POINTS]

- Doors need to be strong, so that they cannot be smashed or kicked in. Glazed panels are a liability—use laminated glass, which is
very hard to break. Fit secure locks and bolts—at least a rim lock and a mortise lock (see <a href="#door-locks">Door locks</a>).
- French windows are easily kicked open if they rely on a single catch. Fit rack bolts top and bottom (<a href="#window-locks">see Window locks</a>).
- Louvre window panes can be lifted from their fittings. Fix them in place with an epoxy resin glue.
- Most domestic glass can be broken or cut. Leaded panes can be removed (almost silently) by peeling back the lead. Double and treble
glazing will act as a deterrent, but won’t keep a burglar out. Laminated or wired glass will slow a burglar down, but the only certain
protection is a metal grille or shutter outside or a sliding metal grille inside (which can be hidden by a pelmet and curtains).
- ALWAYS lock garages/outbuildings—not just to protect the contents but to prevent the use of tools and ladders. Use a toughened-steel
security padlock, one with a close-fitting or shielded loop (shank) to make the use of bolt-cutters difficult. Use coachbolts (with
rounded heads) instead of screws to make the fittings more difficult to prise off. If you must use screws, drill out the slots to prevent
the use of a screwdriver—or use tighten-only screws.
- If ladders are kept outside, chain them to the wall, a fixed pipe or post.
- Paint downpipes with security (anti-climb) paint—it remains slippery, making pipes difficult, if not impossible to climb. It’s
also VERY difficult to get off the skin and clothing, so the thief will be ‘marked’.
- Don‘t allow ANYONE the luxury of a close ’recce’ of your property. If you have a side gate, LOCK IT!.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Keep your glazing puffy in good repair. If it is crumbling and can be picked off, the glass can be removed quite quietly. The sound of a
window being smashed usually attracts attention.

:::

#### Building work?

You are particularly vulnerable when building work is in progress—especially if there is scaffolding outside to give easy access. It
doesn‘t have to be the builders, scaffolders or someone they tipped off about what’s inside—it is obvious to any passer-by that the
house is vulnerable.

With workpeople coming and going, it is less likely that even neighbours will realise the house is being burgled. Always INSIST that ladders are
hauled up at night and chained to scaffolding, well out of reach of ground level.

#### Unoccupied houses

Houses left unoccupied for a long period are sometimes stripped or everything—fireplaces, curtain rods, doorknobs, floorboards, stained
glass panels. There is a booming market in ‘architectural salvage’! If you move out of your home to allow major work to take place, or
delay fully moving in, your furniture, curtains and carpets may disappear! Few people question a removal van being loaded in broad daylight.

#### Moving in?

The danger is even greater when you are moving into a new house and YOU are unknown to the neighbourhood. Introduce yourself to your immediate
neighbours. SOONER OR LATER YOU MAY HAVE TO RELY ON ONE ANOTHER. They will, at least, know that the person climbing through the window is not YOU.
Ask them to keep an eye on the place for you, and offer to do the same for them.

#### How burglars get in

Most burglars enter through ground floor doors and windows. British figures suggest that nearly 50 per cent get in through a side window. About 25
per cent get in through the front door and almost as many by a rear or side door. In many cases, burglars find a door or window unsecured. Forty
per cent have to force a door or window, but it’s a lot less likely that glass will be broken to gain entry. Subtler, but less common methods
include posing as a tradesman or using a key.

:::danger[Warning]

The stereotype of the burglar with a sack of ‘swag’, a mask and a torch climbing down a ladder at night is misleading. About half of
all domestic burglaries happen during daylight hours—when most people are at work.

:::

#### Marking property

It is not very common to get back stolen goods. When things are recovered, positive identification of the objects is extremely difficult unless
you have photographs and full details.

Make a list of all your valuables. This has to be done when arranging full insurance cover. It will also serve as a check list for losses. For
antiques, art objects and valuable jewellery, a photographic record is essential.

Many consumer goods have a serial number—however, these may be removed or defaced. Adding your own marks will identify an object even more
clearly. If they cannot be engraved in an unobtrusive place, use a special marker pen with a pigment which glows under ultra-violet light. It
won’t be noticeable, unless you know where to look. Use your house number (or the first letters of its name if you have no number) followed by
your postal or ZIP code.

:::info[BURGLARS TOP TEN]

Most burglars are looking for things which are easy to carry and easy to sell. It is obviously much easier to dispose of small antiques, than
to find a secret buyer for a painting by Picasso or Rembrandt! Plenty of people are only too willing to buy a watch or video recorder that
‘fell off the back of a lorry’. The most common carry-away items stolen include:

- Jewellery/watches
- Credit cards/cheque books
- Video recorders
- Cameras
- Cash
- Antiques
- Hi-fis/radios
- Personal computers
- Televisions
- Silverware

:::

### DOOR LOCKS

There are many types of lock, but the most secure are those in which the key trips several levers or tumblers. The key is therefore more
complicated to duplicate without a master and the lock is more difficult to pick. Those which have a deadlock action make it impossible to force
the bolt back into its casing without turning a key. Most mortise locks are deadlocks. Some rim locks may double as deadlocks, and are activated
by an extra turn of the key.

From the inside a securing catch will prevent the opening of any rim lock from outside—even with a key. Most people use the catch to keep
the door locked open when they’re frightened of locking themselves out. Some burglars flip the catch so that no one can open the door and
catch them in the act. While you‘re fumbling with your key and wondering why it won’t turn, the thief is escaping.

:::tip[REMEMBER]
Do NOT label keys with your address, room descriptions or house numbers. Doing so only helps a thief if he/she gets hold of them.

:::

#### MORTISE LOCKS

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img143_002.jpg" />

Mortise locks are timed INTO the door, with the bolthole reinforcement (striking plate) let into the door iamb. These locks MUST be drillproof.
The screws are concealed when the door is closed. The bolts MUST have reinforcing pins which prevent them being sawn through.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img143_003.jpg" />

Mortise locks which also have handles (sash locks) are available for interior or exterior doors.

#### RIM LOCKS

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img143_004.jpg" />

Most are designed for surface mounting. The screws are vulnerable, except for those in the door edge and the jamb (when the door is closed).

Preferably, go for a rim cylinder lock with as many ‘extras’ as possible. Interior and exterior deadlocking facilities are sensible, as
are pegs which won’t allow a blade to be inserted from outside to force the bolt back into the lock.

On external doors ALWAYS fit a mortise deadlock. If the door is too thin to take one, get a thicker door! A mortise lock MUST have at least five
levers—cheaper ones have only two. Fit a rim lock as well. Use the rule of thirds:

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img144_001.jpg" />

The rim lock (A) should be positioned one third of the way down from the top of the door. The mortise lock (B) should be positioned one third of
the way up from the bottom of the door.

#### SLIDING DOOR LOCKS

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img144_002.jpg" />

SLIDING DOOR LOCKS Sliding doors are much more difficult to lock securely than conventional doors. Use a hook-and-bolt type, the nearest
equivalent to a mortise deadlock.

If you have metal- or plastic-framed sliding doors and need to fit a lock, the only easy ones to fit are surface-mounted.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Locking internal doors, especially those of rooms with vulnerable windows, will make life difficult for a burglar. On the other hand a really
determined burglar will kick them open. Unfortunately you will then have more damage to deal with.

:::

#### Choosing locks

Ask your locksmith how many ‘differs’ (key permutations) there are for the make and type of lock you intend to buy-choose a lock which has
as many as possible. If the style of lock you use is only available with a few key patterns, a burglar could easily carry all the necessary keys.
Top quality locks may have only one key combination. New keys can only be cut on written request.

:::danger[Warning]

Rim locks which do not have a deadlock facility are useless if the door has glazed panels, cat flaps or letterboxes large enough to put a hand
through. Wooden panels may also be kicked out of the door-no key is needed to open the rim lock from the inside ALWAYS lit a mortise lock as
well. Keep cat flaps out of reach of locks and bolts.

:::

#### COMBINATION LOCKS

Electronic or mechanical push-button combination locks are useful for people who tend to lose keys, or when there have to be a large number of
keyholders. You can change the combination whenever you wish—and won’t have to cut new keys. Drawbacks are that potential thieves may
see you punch the number in, or that you might forget the number. Do NOT write code numbers down. If you are worried about forgetting yours,
include it disguised as part of a fax or phone number in your address book, so that YOU will recognize it but others will not.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img144_003.jpg" />

Sliding bolts on the inside of a door give added security—although these are easily opened by an intruder, once they are inside. They can
quickly be rammed home if you need to prevent forced entry while you are in.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img144_004.jpg" />

Rack bolts can be used on all doors and on wood-framed windows too. There is only one ‘key’ pattern, but keyholes are on the inside
only—making it very difficult to detect these bolts from the outside.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img144_005.jpg" />

On the hinge side, hinge bolts (dog bolts) will help prevent the hinge side of the door from being forced open. These are more difficult to fit
than you may imagine—you may have to call in a professional. The metal ‘bolt’ locates in the reinforced hole when the door is
closed.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img145_001.jpg" />

:::tip[REMEMBER]

No matter how many locks, bolts and hinge bolts you fit, if the door or the frame is weak, you have a problem. Thieves can break doors and
crowbar frames out of the wall. If the door faces a solid wall, a jack might even be used to force the door. Steel doors, steel-reinforced
doors and steel-reinforced door frames are a last resort.

:::

To prevent the door from being kicked in (at least), a stout steel bar fixed firmly down the hinge side of the door frame should prevent the
hinges from being broken out of the wood. On the ‘lock’ side, the steel bar needs to retain the staple of the rim lock.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img145_002.jpg" />

:::danger[Warning]

You should always ‘lock yourself in’ with a mortise lock- especially when settling down for the evening or going to bed. Intruders
have been known to break in and rob a house while the occupants were watching television or sleeping. DON’T FORGET: You will need a key to
open the door-and may need to do so in an emergency. When you leave a multi-occupied building, check that you haven’t locked someone in.

:::

#### ‘Entryphones’

If you want to check on callers without actually having to go to the door, install an audio or CCTV (closed-circuit television)
‘entryphone’. These are becoming increasingly common, especially for multi-occupied buildings. However the voice of an unknown caller
would not necessarily give you any clue as to their intentions. A camera is relatively easy to put out of action and may not reveal an accomplice.
Consider fitting a spyhole as a useful back-up.

:::info[WHO’S THERE?]

A door viewer (peephole)—a small lens which gives you a good look at anyone outside the door—is a sensible addition which allows
you to check all callers. DON’T forget that if you have a bright light on your side of the door you will block the light as you look
through the peephole, making it obvious that you are in. Make sure the viewer has a cover which you can slide open when your head is close to
it. Don’t give your presence away by noisy footsteps as you come downstairs or along a hallway.

:::

:::danger[Warning]
Most peepholes distort the view, even though they allow about 180&deg; vision. If the caller is too close, they may look quite frightening.

1. If you are very short or very tall, the comfortable height for you might not give a good view of the caller
2. A peephole might not let you see someone else lurking behind the caller, or to one side
3. If in any doubt, do NOT open the door

:::

#### Limiters/chains

Door limiters, made from toughened steel, are stronger than chains and can act as an additional bolt when the door is closed. A chain won’t
deter a violent intruder. Once you’ve opened the door, one kick will tear the chain free. Always use longer screws than those usually supplied
with these devices, or they give a false sense of security.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Check all callers: NEVER let strangers into your house without making sure WHO they are and WHAT their business is. Try NEVER to admit them
when you are on your own. Thieves may pose as representatives of gas, water or electricity companies, social workers—even police
officers—to gain entry (<a href="./topicid-136#attack-on-home">see SELF-DEFENCE: Attack at home</a>).

They MUST allow you to take their identification from them and close the door. Don’t just call the number on any business card they show.
The number could be that of an accomplice. Use the telephone directory!

:::

### WINDOW LOCKS

It is preferable to fit locks on ALL windows. Different types are made for different forms of window. It’s something a DIY person could
handle, though you may need a locksmith’s help if the frames are plastic or metal, instead of wood.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img146_001.jpg" />

Most window ‘locks’ use very simple screw mechanisms. There are only a few key shapes—the average burglar is bound to know them all.
For particularly vulnerable windows extra precautions must be taken, fitting REAL locks or locking catches. This may be an expensive
option—or a pointless one if all the burglar needs to do is break the glass. Fit a grille! Don’t forget that YOU may have difficulty
opening the window if it is an emergency escape route.

Accessible windows should be fitted with net curtains, venetian blinds or louvre shutters—anything which prevents an easy view of the
contents of the room.

:::info[DOGS]

Almost all dogs will act as burglar deterrents—their barking will attract attention. Even a small dog can be aggressive in defending its
home against a stranger and can sound ‘bigger’ than it is! Many dogs are friendly to almost anyone who shows interest in them and will
be no actual defence at all—but their presence may be enough to make the opportunist thief look elsewhere.

Large dogs and breeds originally bred as fighting or guard dogs may be both psychological deterrents and practical defenders. All dogs need
training, but with powerful breeds it is particularly important for you to be able to control and trust them. Dogs are pack animals and need a
leader, or they may take over this role and become uncontrollable. Some have a strong sense of territory and will even deny access to your
friends.

Domestic pets (especially when there are children about) should never be encouraged to be overly aggressive. Professional training classes are
advisable for both dog and owners.

:::

### ALARM SYSTEMS

Just the sight of an alarm box may discourage a casual burglar from attempting to break in. Professional burglars know how to deal with alarms and
will do so when they think the job is really worth the effort. Many people feel that the sight of an alarm box on the front of the house alerts
thieves to the fact that you have possessions that you think are worth protection!

If the burglar is not aware that there is an alarm system, the surprise of bells, sirens and flashing lights may scare them off—at least,
they will try to get away as fast as possible. Alarms will alert you (if you are in), and everyone in the neighbourhood, that a robbery is taking
place.

When choosing an alarm system, remember that you will have to set it each time you leave the house or go to bed. If the setting process is fiddly
or has to be done in a hurry to avoid sounding the alarm, you might get very fed up with the system. There is no point in installing an alarm if
you do not use it. Domestic systems are not usually very complicated, but try to ensure that yours offers some flexibility and can be adjusted to
suit your needs.

If you think the main value of a burglar alarm is its deterrent effect, fit a dummy alarm box on an outside wall. It’s cheaper and much less
hassle than having the whole works!

#### SIMPLE ALARMS

A simple battery-operated alarm will alert you if someone opens a door or window. To set the alarm you either turn a key or punch a digital code.
If you live above ground in an apartment block with only one entry door to your property and you want to be alerted if someone enters a garage or
outbuilding, or if you want to restrict access to part of your home (a workshop, perhaps), an alarm like this could be ideal.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img147_001.jpg" />

#### Types of system

Installing an alarm system provides a greater feeling of security but is no substitute for strong locks/grilles and other security measures. Alarm
systems are constantly being updated—take your time to choose one that meets your requirements. Most alarm systems are made up of the same
elements, although the way in which these are linked varies considerably. The three main options are:

- Open circuit. When the circuit is completed by a detector/ triggering device the alarm sounds. To prevent deactivation by the cutting of a
wire, multicore wires are used which contain a back-up circuit that reacts to tampering.
- Closed circuit. When the circuit is broken by a detector/ triggering device, the alarm sounds. Back-up circuits prevent deactivation by
attempting to bridge circuits with additional wires.
- Wireless systems. Each sensor/triggering device is a small short-range transmitter—if the control panel receives a signal from any of
them, the alarm sounds.

#### Control unit

This is the ‘brain’ of the system. Options may include:

- Being able to switch the whole system on/off (with a key or digital keypad).
- Being able to deactivate sections of the system, which would allow you, for instance, to protect the lower floor of a home while the occupants
are using the upper floor.
- Adjustments of the time allowed to leave the building and close the main door.
- Fail-safe devices and tamper alarms, if any attempt is made to deactivate the control panel.
- A back-up power source, which cuts in if there is a power failure for any reason.

#### Detectors/sensors

There are numerous triggering devices available, allowing you to choose a combination to protect your home in many ways.

Magnetic switches will alert you if doors or windows have been opened. Some are surface mounted, but there are ‘hidden’ versions which fit
into the door or window and flame. There are ways to ‘fool’ them. False alarms are unlikely.

Vibration detectors will alert you if a door or window is subjected to slight movement—a door may be kicked or someone may attempt to break
a window. They need to be adjusted to allow for ‘normal’ vibrations to avoid false alarms caused by sudden gusts of wind or heavy traffic.

Foil strips on windows (in closed-circuit systems) break contact if the glass is broken.

Pressure mats are activated by the weight of a person treading on them. They are usually placed under doormats and carpets in places that no one
can avoid. Frequent traffic over them, in places such as the bottom of the stairs, may wear them out or cause their shape to show up through the
carpet.

Movement sensors which emit infra-red, radio or ultrasonic waves are triggered by anything which comes within their field. False alarms may be
caused by children, pets-anything of any size which moves—a tumbling cushion, a large moth near the sensor. Most movement sensors are
adjustable-but take care not to render them too insensitive.

Movement sensors are advisable for external use. On your doorstep, a light can be arranged to come on as anyone approaches the door. Powerful
floodlights can be activated to expose anyone who attempts to approach your home from the front, sides or rear.

#### Alarms/false alarms

Bells, sirens, flashing lights (inside and out) are common. The intention should be to attract attention and (hopefully) to scare off an intruder.
Do NOT invest in a system which cannot be programmed to switch off after a selected period (20-30 minutes or as dictated by local
legislation)—otherwise false alarms which sound for several hours will make neighbours very angry indeed. Try to arrange for a trusted
neighbour to have access to deactivate the alarm. Too many false alarms in a neighbourhood and people may stop paying attention to them.

Inform the police that you have had an alarm fitted and supply the names of all keyholders who can enter your home and switch off the alarm. More
recent innovations are alarms which cease to sound after a predetermined period-and then re-arm themselves.

In an area where alarms are a nuisance or there is no one to hear them, they should be linked directly to the police or a security company. There
need be no indication to the intruder that the alarm has been triggered and that the police are on their way. This arrangement can be very
expensive, especially since there are penalties for false alarms.

To protect security system wires from malicious damage, ask telephone and security companies NOT to run them on outer walls where they can be cut
or tampered with. If this is unavoidable, feed them through sturdy conduits.

:::info[PANIC BUTTONS]

Most systems can incorporate panic buttons. These are particularly sensible for the elderly and people living alone. Have as many as you feel
you need—one beside the bed, one in each room. If you are attacked in your home, or have an accident that requires urgent medical
attention, hit the button! Panic alarms for wireless systems may be powerful enough to work outside the house—if you were sitting in the
garden, for instance.

:::

#### Personal alarms

If you are elderly, or live alone, you may need to rely on your neighbours in an emergency. A simple wired ‘doorbell’ from your house to
theirs may suffice, but the problem is that neighbours are not always in.

Systems are now available which involve you carrying a small transmitter or wearing one like a wristwatch. When triggered within an area that
would easily include house and garden, it will automatically transmit a signal down a telephone line if help is suddenly needed because of
illness, accident or threat. This alerts a 24-hour monitoring centre, which calls back immediately to check for accidental false alarms and will
send help if there is no reply.

If such a system is used, a codeword or phrase should be arranged from the outset. A victim of attack may be forced to say that nothing is wrong,
but if the codeword is used the monitoring centre will know they are under duress.

#### If you need advice

Advice. on all security matters—from locks to full security systems—is available from several sources:

- Local police, who will also have a good knowledge of any particular local problems
- Insurance companies
- Lock and alarm manufacturers and installers

:::info[KEEP WATCH]

Neighbourhood Watch, Crimewatch and comparable vigilance schemes, In which neighbours form a group to beat local crime, have been started in
many cities all over the world. The idea is for everyone to keep an eye out for any peculiar or suspicious activity—strangers paying
unusual attention to a house, for instance—and report it to the police. Such groups also serve to develop members’ awareness of
security.

Times have changed—small close-knit communities could usually spot a stranger, but it is impossible nowadays to know the pattern of
other people’s lives and to recognize their friends and visitors in most large cities. On the other hand, in densely-populated areas there
may be more eyes to do the watching! Even where there has been no positive reduction in the local crime rate, such schemes seem to have led to
better relations within the community and to a reduction in stress from fear of crime.

If you want to start or join such a group, your local police station will be able to tell you who to contact—or how to start one.

LOOK OUT FOR...

- Strangers knocking on front doors and peering through windows
- Anyone loitering suspiciously
- Cars cruising slowly
- Strangers hanging around schools and playing fields
- Strangers approaching children
- ‘Casual’ window cleaners
- Strangers trying car doors
- People you do not recognize disappearing round the back of properties

:::

### LEAVING THE HOUSE

- Always lock all doors, close and lock all windows. Check that keys have not been left in locks.
- Leave lights on if you are out at night—not just a hallway or porch light. Use a timeswitch so that they come on at dusk (random ones
switch lights on and off ‘realistically’).
- At night, ALWAYS draw curtains or close shutters so that no one can see in.
- Leave a radio on.
- Burglars tend to be wary of a dog—it might attack them or attract attention by its barking. If you have no desire for a dog, you could
try a ‘dog alarm’. Some of the more recent ones have quite a realistic ’bark’. You could set it up with a vibration or
movement detector.
- Make sure valuables are not visible through windows.
- Always close a garage door—an empty garage is an indication that you are not at home.
- Always lock garage/outbuilding doors to prevent access to tools or ladders.
- Do not leave a key in ANY hiding place—however ‘clever’ you think it is. Leave a key with a friend or trusted neighbour in case
you lose yours.
- If you let workmen have keys to the house, change the main rim locks afterwards (and consider changing the mortise locks too). Keep the old
rim lock cylinder and key—you can replace them if you need to change the keys again. This is where a digital combination lock can be an
advantage! You only have to change the combination.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Random timers, which switch the lights on and off erratically, can help create an impression that the house is occupied. Regular timers with
one or more on/off phases allow you to create your own pattern of lights. A very observant burglar, who is keeping an eye on YOUR home over
several nights, may notice repeating patterns. It will certainly be noticed if no lights ever come on!

:::

:::info[PHONE SENSE]

- NEVER leave an answering machine message for callers to tell them that you are out. A message such as ‘We can’t come to the phone
at the moment’ leaves a certain doubt as to whether the house is occupied or not.
- If you regularly need to give callers numbers at which you can be contacted, NEVER do so on your prerecorded answering machine message.
Arrange with the telephone company for calls to be automatically transferred. You will have to pay for the service, but callers will be
unaware that they have not got through on the number they dialled.

:::

#### Going away

- Ask trusted neighbours to be observant and keep an eye open for any suspicious activity.
- Cancel all deliveries—but do NOT leave notes outside the door to advertise the fact.
- Ask a neighbour to ensure that nothing is left outside and that mail/circulars are not hanging out of the letterbox.
- Leave curtains OPEN—it looks less unusual to have them open at night than to have them closed during the day.
- If possible get neighbours or friends to come in and switch lights on and off and close the curtains during the evening. Their activity will
help to make the house look occupied.
- If you have a driveway, ask a neighbour or friend to park there occasionally instead of outside their own house.
- If away for a long period and you have a lawn, get a neighbour to trim it for you or it will be another sign that you are away.
- Take valuables to the bank safe deposit.
- Best of all—arrange for a reliable friend to move in while you are away. Cities are full of people sharing accommodation or living with
relations. They may welcome a break on their own—they solve the problem of looking after pets and plants as well!

#### Returning home

By day: Ensure everything is as you expect it to be. Give the house a quick scan from as many sides as possible for obvious signs—a forced
door or broken windows. If there are ANY signs of disturbance or anything that makes you suspicious, go to a neighbour’s house and telephone
the police. DO NOT GO INTO YOUR HOME. THE INTRUDERS MAY STILL BE THERE.

By night: Having an outside light left on, or one activated by a movement detector, makes it easier to check for signs of entry. Are curtains
disturbed? Are the correct lights on/off? If you arrive by car and see any sign of trouble, drive on. Go to a neighbour’s or a callbox to call
the police. Even if all seems OK, DON’T put the car away. Park/lock the car and go closer to check that everything is normal. If you still
feel something is wrong, do NOT go in.

:::info[INTRUDERS AT NIGHT]

If you are woken at night by the sound of intruders, do NOT attempt to confront them? Don’t pretend to be asleep either? Switch on lights
and make plenty of noise as though you are unaware someone else is in the house. If you are on your own, call out and pretend to be talking to
someone else (it may help if the imaginary companion is male). Telephone the police from the bedroom or as soon as you can safely reach your
phone.

## **SECURITY AT WORK**

A large commercial or industrial establishment with secret processes and highly ‘sensitive’ information MUST be as secure as a prison-only
in reverse. Several rings of security may be needed to keep people OUT. Devices of the types used for domestic security, often in more
sophisticated forms, can be used to alert people to a break-in outside work hours. During work hours, thorough security procedures will also be
necessary.

Obviously, the level of secrecy of the work in hand dictates the level of security needed. Most businesses have some sort of information which may
be useful to competitors—yet many businesses have VERY low security standards! In extreme cases an outer fence, patrolled at night or
protected by guard dogs, should be considered. The number of gates should be kept to a minimum and strictly controlled.

There should be only one main entrance, monitored by a security guard or team. Final entry to the premises should be through a controlled
door—to avoid people ‘slipping’ past. Inner layers of even greater security may be required, with only one route leading to areas
where secret work is undertaken or strong rooms/safes and ‘sensitive’ records are kept. Access to such areas should be limited to
authorized personnel.

Visitors must NOT be allowed to wander unescorted around a building at their leisure. It is amazing how many companies DO have ‘secrets’
of one sort or another, yet report that ‘casual’ thieves have wandered in and stolen employees’ coats, bags and possessions! A
‘professional’ thief should find easy pickings in such a place.

When work hours are over, all unnecessary access routes should be sealed. Staff in ‘sensitive’ areas should be disciplined to leave
NOTHING on show, to lock computer disks away and to be VERY careful what they throw in waste bins. Spies are not above ’raiding the
garbage’.

#### Reception desks

High-security measures are inappropriate for many businesses, but some form of control must be exercised to ensure that unauthorised visitors do
not gain entrance. A voice communication link—an ‘entryphone’—will only allow nominal identification. The drawbacks are
enormous-the telephonist cannot see if the person is alone or if they are carrying a weapon, for instance. If all expected visitors’ names and
the purposes of their visits are kept in a log book, a receptionist could (at least) tell if the caller has an appointment.

A closed-circuit television (CCTV) entry system would give more chance to vet a visitor, who could be asked to show credentials to the camera. The
camera should be linked to a video recorder-this alone might deter a dishonest person who does not want to be recognized.

A receptionist is the most common way of forestalling visitors, and an effective one if access beyond his/her position is physically controlled. A
‘panic’ button should be fitted below the reception desk, or somewhere else within easy reach, so that assistance can be rapidly summoned.
An extreme example might be that a receptionist could be attacked or be taken hostage for bargaining by hostile intruders.

:::danger[Warning]

There must ALWAYS be someone at a reception or security desk. Depending on the level of security required, no responsible member of stall
should leave their post for ANY reason (least of all a reason suggested by the visitor) without someone ‘standing in’ for them.

:::

:::info[WALK-IN THEFT]

Walk-in theft is common. Thieves may be quite daring—although when most people are busy at their job, it is easy to steal things without
being noticed. DON’T MAKE IT EASY FOR THIEVES. If you have a one-person office or workshop, lock the door whenever you leave—even if
only for a few minutes. NEVER leave wallets or clothing unattended or on your desk. Bags, in particular, should never be left hanging over a
chair or on the floor.

Portable expensive equipment, such as computers, should be protected in some way. Companies often ‘brand’ their names into the plastic
casings, instal ‘theft alert’ tags which sound an alarm if the equipment is carried past a ’theft detector’ at a prescribed
point, or fix the equipment to desks. There are also cables which, when unplugged from equipment, will trigger alarms.

:::

#### Escort all visitors

Breaches of security are more usual at night, but many thieves and spies just walk in and walk out unchallenged. ALL members of staff should be
instructed to question EVERY unknown person not accompanied by known personnel. This can be done by offering help and escorting the visitor to the
appropriate person/department, or waiting with them until someone arrives to deal with them. NEVER let a non staff-member move around the premises
unaccompanied. AVOID escorting unknown visitors alone if you have to pass through unoccupied areas or corridors. NEVER walk in front of unknown
visitors-keep an eye on them at all times.

### SCREEN/CHECKPOINTS

#### Identity cards

Each ring of security must be controlled by security card-operated or digital keypad locks or manned by security staff. Staff at
reception/checkpoints should NOT be expected to remember all faces and names of all personnel. Identity cards with photographs are commonly used
and can be worn on duty, giving continual authorization throughout the building. These may also incorporate magnetic stripes which carry
information regarding the bearer’s identity and security status.

In companies where there may be a high turnover of staff, or where a large number of staff need access to many areas, ordinary keys would be
totally impractical. Magnetic and keypad codes could be constantly updated, whereas ordinary locks would have to be changed and new keys cut.

#### PIN systems

Greater levels of security can be obtained by computer-controlled systems, where each employee not only has a card with a magnetic stripe, but
also has to use a personal identity number (PIN)—just as you do when using a bank’s self-service cash machine.

#### Transmitter/infra-red

An alternative to consider is a system which uses a small radio transmitter (similar to ones used to open automatic garage doors) or an infra-red
‘remote control’ (similar to those which operate car alarms and domestic electronic equipment such as televisions and hi-fis). It may be
possible to ‘personalize’ these to individual employees, but this system should not be expected to work on its own. A transmitter might
fall into the wrong hands.

#### PFI systems

In extreme cases, security can be provided by systems which use recognition of personal features to screen individuals. PFI (personal feature
identification) can be based upon voice, hand or fingerprints or, amazingly, the pattern on the retina at the back of the eye.

PFI systems used to be relatively slow in operation, but the development of sophisticated microchips has now made them an effective but expensive
way of controlling access. Their only real drawback (apart from the cost) is that they have a small error rate—between one and five per cent
for voice prints. Although a system like this may exclude (and annoy) some people who are entitled to access, it will NOT admit anyone it does not
recognize.

#### Timer locks

Timing devices can be used with both electronic and conventional locks to refuse entry. Even authorized personnel will be denied access. Not only
will this prevent members of staff from moving around the premises when they are not entitled to, but it will also deny them access if they are
placed under threat in any way. All safes and vaults should ALWAYS incorporate a timer.

#### Double-door entry systems

For an extremely high-security reception checkpoint at a main entrance or between security levels, a ‘trap’ between two sets of locked
doors could be considered. The ‘trap’ could be monitored by CCTV, a video recorder and a microphone for further communication with a
visitor. A built-in metal detector could be used to detect weapons, metal objects and tape recorders. A theft detector could sound an alarm if an
attempt is made to carry out security-tagged portable material or equipment.

Such systems would slow down escape from high-security areas in the event of tire or other emergency. Safety may have to be balanced against
security. There is always a risk of a ‘fake’ emergency being created or a door held open after the passage of a legitimate user-though
this would become especially difficult with a ‘trap’ system.

### GUARDS/GUARD PATROLS

Stationary guards or watchmen may require electronic alarms and CCTV surveillance equipment to enable them to know what is going on around a
building, supplemented by guard patrols. Dogs can be used to announce the presence of intruders as well as deterring them.

Patrol times should not follow obvious patterns or else intruders would know when to expect them. Intruders may be able to calculate time taken
between one point and another-routes should be varied. Professional thieves might even use their own temporary electronic sensors/detectors to let
them know when someone is approaching.

Finding reliable guards is difficult. Do NOT seek to save money-good security pays for itself! Use an established and reputable company or train
your own guards, if your organization is big enough to do so.

Limit the number of tasks a security guard has to do-he/ she cannot be in several places at once! Monitor the guard’s work to ensure that
he/she does not become too bored. They must be alert at all times.

Never forget that it is lonely, slightly-risky work sitting at a security desk. Sooner or later a friendly ‘visitor’ is bound to try to
start a conversation with the guard-who may be glad of the companionship. If the ‘visitor’ is clever, he/she may be able to gather all
kinds of information.

:::info[BASIC BRIEF FOR GUARDS]

- ALWAYS go by the rule book
- NEVER allow access without full authentication by the person/department expecting the visitor
- CONFIRM identification for any repairmen, service engineers, ‘official’ visitors and representatives
- DON’T confirm by telephone at numbers or using names supplied by visitors. Use your own sources. Make prior arrangements for regular
visitors—these may include ringing a contact number to confirm arrival of a visitor and an appropriate security password

:::

#### External vulnerability

You may not be in a position to organize a high perimeter wall, rolls of barbed wire, electric fences and guards in watchtowers but you CAN apply
the same basic principles to any situation. It is very unlikely in the centre of a city that a site could be surrounded with a protective zone.
It’s likely that there may be public access around the building, which of course makes doors/ windows highly vulnerable.

Really determined intruders may make approaches from underground, through adjoining buildings or from the roof. Ideally all possible routes of
entry or weak areas require protection, although most ‘professional’ thieves find they don’t have too much trouble. They KNOW the
obvious steps which may be taken to secure premises.

Concentric rings of defence can compensate for external vulnerability. Penetrating the outer rings will not necessarily allow access to the real
target of the intruder. A concentric system also makes it much more difficult to use even sophisticated surveillance techniques from outside the
building.

Specialist advice should be called in when very high level protection is required or when the site is vulnerable to a break in security.

:::info[INDELIBLE EVIDENCE]

Video recorders linked to a CCTV surveillance system permit close scrutiny of intruders and their methods. Dye-smoke devices are sometimes
used to spray dye at intruders, marking clothes and skin with a harmless but long-lasting colour. Some of these dyes are invisible except in
special lighting conditions.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Can entry be made to your premises:

Via ventilation and other ducts?

Via sewers or other underground service channels?

From the roof-especially if there is access from adjoining or neighbouring buildings within roping distance?

Through the walls of adjoining properties, including cellars and roof spaces?

:::

:::info[GUARD DOGS]

Dogs for guarding commercial and industrial premises are usually chosen from breeds which have been developed for their strong territorial
sense and fighting qualities. German shepherd dogs (Alsatians), Rottweilers and Dobermans are frequently used. They may develop close
alliances with their handlers, but should not be treated as domestic pets. To treat a guard dog as a family pet is to confuse both roles, and
you risk undermining the dog’s effectiveness. More seriously, the dog could pose a threat to other family members.

Guard dogs MUST be reared to follow a strict discipline and this must be maintained. They MUST be trained to control and restrain intruders,
not to kill them, but must be tenacious up to the point of inflicting serious injury. Very careful training is required for both dogs and
handlers.

An intruder may try to make friends with dogs by bringing food several times. Dogs must be taught to resist such temptations.
Drugging/poisoning dogs is an old technique which should be a thing of the past. Dog ‘whistles’ and ’deterrents’ which emit a
sound that is beyond the range of human hearing should have no effect either. Real guard dogs should be impervious to all
distractions—even the sound of gunshots.

:::

### SAFE/VAULTS

In a concentric security system—consisting of rings of tight security—the innermost ring is the safe, strongroom or vault. It should
protect its contents from the actions of thieves, from fire, explosion and flood.

A safe should be totally immovable but, just in case, should withstand being dropped from a great height. Skilled safe-crackers use a variety of
means, from acids and electronic listening devices to crowbars, high-powered burning equipment and explosive charges to open a safe. Safes are
actually graded according to the time it takes a ‘top’ safe-cracker to open them. To be efficient a safe cannot rely on locks, but must
withstand all forms of attack.

Vaults must protect their contents, even if the building around them is destroyed, and must also withstand the effects of fire hoses being played
upon their heated outer casings. Doors and walls of a vault are usually rated according to the number of hours for which they can withstand fire.

The degree of protection you must seek to achieve should be matched against the importance of the ‘valuables’. Find out exactly what
specifications mean on any safe/vault. If there was an explosion, would the contents be totally unaffected?, Would documents still be legible?

:::info[DOCUMENT SECURITY]

Restricting access to documents and keeping them in a secure safe is only the beginning of document security. There are other ways of
discovering their content. Rough notes, unwanted research material and all ‘sensitive’ waste MUST be destroyed. Carbon papers carry an
impression of everything typed using them, as do typewriter and printer ribbons. They must also be destroyed.

Computer print-outs, however obscure, can provide information—facts and figures can be interpreted or passwords, codes and program
structures may be revealed to a skilled interpreter. Sensitive waste should be placed through a slot into locked waste bins and shredded at
the end of the day within the secure area.

:::

### COUNTERING ESPIONAGE

‘Spying’ isn’t always about selling vital national secrets-it goes on in all areas of business, especially where there is great
competition. ANYONE can buy bugging equipment and other ‘toys’ from specialist shops or by mail order.

Modern lenses make it possible to view and photograph images at considerable distances. Listening devices can monitor conversations. Interception
of electronic data and even the electromagnetic radiation from computer terminals can provide a source of information. Sensitive material should
be protected from ALL such forms of spying.

:::danger[Warning]

Phone tapping is illegal in most countries. In Britain, you must have a warrant from the Secretary of State or the consent of the person being
tapped! You could face a fine or imprisonment. Mere possession of bugging equipment is not illegal, but use could constitute a prosecutable
offence.

:::

#### Cameras

Cameras should obviously be forbidden in areas where secrets are kept, but it is very difficult to identify a camera built into a wristwatch, a
briefcase or a cigarette lighter—these are a cliche, but ARE available and DO get used!

Unless you make all staff and visitors change into special clothing and remove all jewellery how can you be sure they do not have a camera?
Vigilance for any suspicious activity on the part of all members of staff is necessary. Ask yourself why the visitor keeps looking at his/her
wristwatch, or why he/she seems to place his/her briefcase with such care?

Cameras can now be equipped with endoscope attachments which can be inserted through keyholes, though any small aperture drilled through a wall,
through ventilation grilles and cabling ducts.

Long-range lens systems allow photographs to be taken from considerable distances. For maximum security never handle documents or place
typewriters, printers, or computer screens where they can be seen from a window—at ANY level in the building. Even with fairly amateur
equipment, a readable photograph of a document can be obtained at a distance of 90m (300ft).

#### Telephone tapping

Governments may employ telephone tapping as part of surveillance of suspected terrorists, and to provide information about political activists and
criminals. SUCH TAPPING HAS TO BE OFFICIALLY AUTHORIZED AND ANY OTHER TAPPING IS ILLEGAL. It does not necessarily involve linkage directly into
the main telephone system—bugging individual telephones, for instance, is far too easy and far too common.

Radio telephones, car phones, and cordless phones are even easier to ‘tune in’ on. They should never be used for conversations which need
to be kept secret. Even the use of a baby alarm or similar domestic listening device makes it possible for outsiders to eavesdrop more easily.

#### Dealing with tapping

With a standard telephone system an efficient telephone tap is undetectable to the subject, although many people who suspect tapping of their
phones have reported clicks, echoes and an unusually high number of service problems on the line. However, special equipment is available which
will indicate the presence of a tape recorder, a telephone transmitter or a direct wire tap.

If you suspect tapping, or wish to protect information, fit a scrambling device. Systems are available on the open market which can offer a choice
of 145 billion different codes. If these are continually changed, only chance (or other forms of espionage) will enable the eavesdropper to
identify the code. Since the recipient of a call MUST be using a scrambler with the same code, this is only a practical solution for a limited
number of regular calls. Portable, less-versatile versions enable scrambled calls to be made from any phone.

A device which works with all calls on the line is a telephone observation neutraliser. This sends a powerful current down the line which will
melt transmitter wires—it could also damage the telephone line so its use is NOT permitted by most telephone companies!

#### Bugs

Microphones with transmitters can be fixed to a telephone or hidden ANYWHERE in a room, allowing others to eavesdrop and/or record everything that
is said.

Several kinds of bug detector are available, disguised in many ways, from packets of cigarettes to standard desk accessories and office
equipment—so that they can be used in circumstances where a certain amount of subtlety is required.

To defeat any undiscovered bugs, a transmitter can be used to ‘jam’ their transmissions. To avoid having to use elaborate equipment to
identify the exact transmitting frequency of the bug, the jamming equipment should constantly sweep through a wide range of frequencies. This will
have the effect of swamping the spy signal.

#### Long-distance listening devices

Highly directional microphones can focus on sounds at very long distances. There are mass-market devices which claim to detect a whisper at 30
metres (100 feet). The advertisements always have phrases such as ‘a boon to the hard-of-hearing’-whereas they are actually a boon to
anyone who wants to invade people‘s privacy. If sufficiently sensitive, long-range listening devices can ’read’ a conversation from
the vibration of the windows of a room! This is how laser ‘microphones’ work!

Such equipment can be confused by using another sound source—loud music, a noisy computer printer or other machinery close to your
conversation point.

More thorough protection, which will interfere with all audio-reception devices, is given by using a device to generate white and pink noise at
frequencies which are inaudible to the human ear.

#### Avoiding bugs

If your security needs are not great enough to warrant investing in special equipment, the best way of avoiding eavesdropping equipment is to
carry on sensitive conversations in the open and in very public places where there is plenty of background noise-traffic, fountains, music.

Keep moving so that eavesdroppers continually have to change range and focus. Indoors go into a bathroom and run a shower with a radio playing.
Don‘t forget the possibility of lipreading or that either you or the person you are speaking to might be ’wearing’ a bug.

#### Strange but true

If you think cameras concealed in lighters and briefcases with secret compartments belong in James Bond movies, think again—the range of
security devices currently available is phenomenal, and in many cases, ingenious. Micro technology means that bugs, transmitters, even tape
recorders can be reduced to minute proportions and, when concealed in ‘ordinary’ items, are undetectable to the casual observer. A
microphone can be reduced to the size of a match and a whole roommonitoring system, complete with camera, can be concealed within a
‘normal’ book.

Entire offices can be kitted out with desk accessories and equipment where nothing is quite what it seems. A desk light can double up as an
observation system, with a miniature video camera and recorder installed into the base. This means that the user can secretly see and record the
activities in a room without being present. Alternatively, how about a flamed print or picture for a conference room wall—again, complete
with its own observation system. Even a tropical plant placed decoratively in a corner can house a wireless transmission/ reception device,
artfully concealed in a bamboo cane!

On the move, an anti-kidnap device is equipped with a quartz pulse-transmitter to help in locating the victim. A jacket button can double up as a
microphone, and a handy can of ‘X-ray spray’ makes the contents of sealed envelopes visible. Watches (and lighters!) with secret built-in
cameras complete the picture.

### COMPUTERS

#### Computer eavesdropping

Although modern computer terminals emit much less electromagnetic radiation than in the past, it is still possible to use sensitive equipment to
pick up radiation from computer terminals. Radiation travels through water pipes and power lines as well as through the air.

The proximity from which this radiation can be detected varies considerably from system to system—the cost of such eavesdropping, especially
at any real distance, means that it is only likely to be used if the stakes are high. Tests can be carried out to discover the radiation levels
your system emits. It has been reported that certain national military control centres are enclosed in copper-lined vaults to avoid such
‘eavesdropping’.

#### Computer hacking

Any computer linked to a large network or outside sources, such as the telephone line, is vulnerable to ‘hacking’—unauthorized
access to gain information or to alter or corrupt data and programs. Whether the hacker‘s aim is to steal secrets, sabotage a competitor’s
files or simply to play a malicious joke, the means will be the same.

:::danger[Warning]
Computer hacking is ILLEGAL. Spreading computer viruses is a ‘joke’ that could land you in jail!

:::

To avoid casual tampering or snooping at your terminal, arrange sensitive files carefully. Name them in ways YOU can recognize but others would
not. It is possible on most good computers to arrange ‘partitions’ to hide really sensitive information. If done correctly, no casual
‘spy’ will even spot the partition, let alone be able to breach it without a password. Anyone who can open up the program and interpret it
might detect the partition.

#### Coded access

Codes may be used to prevent unauthorized access to files, parts of files or whole systems. As with all codes, it is possible that other people
may be able to decipher them. The more complicated they are and the more stages there are to discover the more difficult this will be, but also
the more time it will take for those with authorization to gain entry. Too many codes and the procedure may be too difficult to remember. There
would be a temptation to write codes down—which immediately makes them vulnerable.

Many people, quite naturally, choose codes with personal associations—the names of their children in birth order, the name of a favourite
holiday resort, their favourite food. However, a saboteur could research such personal information to try to arrive at the correct codes. Using a
series of figures linked with telephone numbers, social security numbers or birth dates is risky for the same reason.

In selecting codes, mixtures of letters and figures are preferable—to produce a wider range of variables. The longer the code the more
numerous the variables become.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

When unattended, secret and sensitive disks should be locked in a safe or vault. Simple storage boxes could be smashed open or taken away and
broken into later. Information on disks could not only be read, but also altered. Fortunately the time taken and expense involved in breaking
codes and operating surveillance can be prohibitive.

:::

#### Computer viruses

Viruses that infect computers or computer networks behave, in some ways, like real diseases. A computer network could suddenly become very
‘sick’. Most are stupid, but often devastating, practical jokes—others may constitute serious sabotage. Only when a program begins
to go wrong does the ‘sickness’ become apparent.

Viruses are ‘caught’ when a program containing the virus is fed into the system. Once it has entered, it can affect other programs, disks,
terminals and networks. Viruses can also be transmitted down telephone lines.

#### Screening for viruses

Fortunately, screening programs are now available which can check every new disk for viruses. These screening programs should be used at the
beginning and end of every work period (at least) on every terminal and before and after ANY new disk is inserted.

Checks on disks from outside sources should be made at a terminal which is not linked to others and not used for other work. In this way a virus
can only be caught by that terminal and can be ‘cured’ or erased on that terminal. Modems (phone links) should NOT allow access to a whole
network—a terminal should be set aside to receive incoming transmissions so that outside ‘infection’ can be contained.

Anti-viral ‘disinfectant’ programs are available to ’cure’ most known viruses.

#### Funny but deadly

Most viruses are created by fairly clever people with ‘nothing better to do’, although there may be cases of revenge by unhappy employees.
One of the first known was a ‘time bomb’-viruses are often designed to do their work at a prescribed time, or to be triggered when certain
conditions occur. The time bomb involved a ‘Happy Birthday’ greeting to one of the largest computer corporations on a special anniversary.
The fullscreen greeting popped up on VDUs all over the world.

Viruses can cause extremely odd problems—and may not be spotted until it‘s too late. Some only ’mess up’ programs or
systems—others are more ‘imaginative’. It’s impossible to predict what the next joker may dream up but—to give you an
idea—here are some examples of real viruses:

- The cursor dies and falls to the bottom of the screen or becomes ‘bouncy’ and impossible to control with a mouse.
- One figure in a huge column of figures spontaneously changes—every nine becomes a four, for example.
- A picture appears across the screen—one famous example was a very rude drawing of a naked woman. While the operator stares in surprise
the entire memory of the hard disk in his/her terminal is erased.
- Obscene words appear in the middle of innocent documents, often triggered by common word combinations.
- Obscene insults to the user flash up on the screen.

Perhaps the weirdest aspect of viruses is that some have been known to lie dormant for long periods of time, to mutate or even combine with other
viruses to produce new ones. Strict screening procedures have helped to reduce the spread—but enormous damage has been done.

## **VEHICLES**

Cars should always be securely locked when parked. Choose a fairly busy location—under a streetlamp at night, if you can’t park in a
garage or off the road. Make sure that all windows and sunroofs are secured. In Britain alone, a car is stolen every two minutes!

A variety of devices is available to prevent the car from being driven, even if a thief has a key that fits the ignition or bypasses the ignition.
There are simple restraining bars to lock the steering wheel to a pedal, or immobilize the gear stick. Increasingly, locking devices may be built
into the car itself.

Car alarms, like those for buildings, operate in a variety of ways. Some use infra-red beams to detect any movement within the car. Others are
vibration detectors which respond to movement of the car itself—some are so sensitive that even touching the car can set them off. Careful
adjustment is necessary if there are not to be repeated false alarms.

#### Radios

NEVER leave valuables in a car-or if there is no option then make sure that they are locked out of sight—don’t tempt thieves! Car stereo
systems are a favourite of thieves. Some car manufacturers are coding digitally-tuned radios to match the individual car. An experienced thief
should recognize this type and leave it alone. One drawback that was found with this system is that they have to be returned to the manufacturer
to be reset, if your battery ever runs down.

Other radios are made to slide into and out of the fascia board. They can be removed easily so that you take them with you. If you forget or
don‘t bother, it is just as easy for a thief to slip the radio out! DON’T hide it under the seat—that is the first place a thief
will look! Take it with you. The drawback is that you may simply lose the radio!

#### Motorcycles/bicycles

Motorcycles have steering locks to prevent them being ridden away by thieves but that will not deter professionals who may load them on a lorry.
Chain them to railings, a lamppost or other fixture. A cable alarm system can be used which will be activated if it is severed.

Bicycles are particularly vulnerable to theft. The whole bike needs securing—thieves commonly steal individual bicycle parts. An expensive
front wheel should have a quick-release mechanism. Detach it, run the security cable or chain through it, through the back wheel and the frame and
around a fixed post. Even this, however, will not deter a determined thief.
