Most people avoid violence. This is not weak, it's sensible. The pressure of city living has led to a dramatic increase in violent crime.
Minimize the risks to yourself. It's time to decide how you will defend yourself, if the worst happens.

## **THE LAW**

Our lives are affected, usually improved, by the laws which govern us. After all, we help to make them! Most people only come into contact with
the police in order to give evidence as a witness—in which case we must learn how to observe and remember as much detail as possible.

Occasionally, the 'boot may be on the other foot'. Through mistaken identity, foolhardy behaviour (often linked with alcohol) or
'being in the wrong place at the wrong time', we may find ourselves caught up in the processes of arrest and detainment. Such a situation
needs very careful handling if it is not to escalate and get out of control.

Much as the police must be trusted to enforce law and order, there is sufficient evidence that mistakes do occur. In a violent struggle, the
police may not be able to tell which person is the aggressor. A joke or a gesture from you in a heated situation might be extremely unadvisable.
The police ARE people. They will, like most of us, make the occasional error, panic or misinterpret a situation.

YOU may misinterpret the law! You may be carrying a brick to the local builders' supplier to match the colour. It may be seen as an offensive
weapon.

### SELF-DEFENCE

Understanding a few points of law might help you to avoid trouble. Most of us never have contact with the police or courts. Some of us may, if
only by mistake.

#### Legal limits

You may only do what is 'reasonably necessary' to defend yourself from attack. Each case is different—so what is 'reasonably
necessary' will vary. British law actually states that you can 'use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of
crime'. If you genuinely believe your life is at stake, 'reasonable force' may be quite extreme, even involving a weapon in some
circumstances.

Basically, the action you take to defend yourself or your property must not be excessive. If the law thinks you overdid it, YOU may be liable for
prosecution. You are NOT allowed to carry weapons, including chemical sprays, for self-defence.

The law expects the victim to run away or withdraw when threatened by violence, but this is not always possible.

#### Offensive weapons

1. Q. What is an offensive weapon?  
   A. A weapon intended or adapted to cause injury and carried for such use by the possessor. A spanner/wrench may be an offensive weapon, unless
   you are a mechanic travelling home with a kit of tools.

2. Q. Who decides if a weapon is offensive?  
   A. Usually a judge or jury, or the weapon may be obviously offensive, such as a flick knife.

3. Q. Can I carry work equipment and sports kits without fear of problems from the police?  
   A. The law accepts that tool kits and sports equipment are carried by necessity or for a genuine reason. You are allowed to carry objects
   which form part of a national costume or for religious reasons.

4. Q. Where can I be liable to encounter problems regarding carrying offensive weapons?  
   A. In any public place—street, park, sports event, entertainment centre, public transport.

5. Q. What if the friends I am with are found to possess offensive weapons? Am I liable?  
   A. The court must prove you had a 'common purpose' with the carriers of the weapons.

6. Q. Can I carry articles with points or blades?  
   A. You may be liable to a fine or imprisonment. You may only carry a folding pocket knife with a blade no longer 75mm (3in).

7. Q. What can I use in my house to defend myself?  
A. If you keep a brick for hitting burglars with, you may be in trouble. If you grab a walking stick and use it as a defensive weapon, you
should be within the law—as long as you don't overdo it. The brick was obviously intended to cause harm.

#### Firearms

Firearms represent more of a risk than a serious form of protection. Having such weapons in your home may pose a severe threat to
children—or to all the members of a household if the weapons are misused by an intruder.

Attitudes to firearms vary enormously around the world. In the US, for instance, the 'right to bear arms' is part of The Constitution.
Even though there is legislation, there are an enormous number of cases where weapons are misused. The legal requirements in Britain, however,
probably give the safest guidelines for owning and storing weapons.

-   No one may own a firearm unless he or she is a member of a shooting or hunting club.
-   No application for a weapon licence will be considered unless the applicant has been a member of such a club for a set period of time.
-   A licence is valid for only three years. Regular inspections are made to ensure that the owner is adhering to ALL the rules governing the
    possession, use and storage of a firearm.
-   The owner will be expected to keep the actual weapon in a purpose-built, steel, lockable cabinet which is bolted to a floor or wall. A safe
    may not be good enough.
-   Ammunition must also be stored under such conditions-but in another location from the weapon.
-   This storage must meet the approval of the police—who will check that regulations are not breached.
-   If carrying the weapon through the streets, it must be in a locked security case—it must not be loaded. Ammunition may not be carried in
    the same case.
-   In a car it is not sufficient to lock a weapon in the glove compartment or boot (trunk). A lockable steel security box, fixed to the vehicle,
    must be provided.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

The above regulations cover firearms only. Powerful crossbows are not covered by such rules, but if they were carried through the streets (to
a sporting event, perhaps) you would be liable to prosecution for carrying an offensive weapon. Air weapons—guns or rifles—do not
fall within firearms guidelines, but are covered by other rules. You should check with the police, since you may be arrested if, for instance,
you fire an air weapon near a public place or highway.

:::

### THE POLICE

Aside from traffic incidents, most of us have very few dealings with the police. Occasionally we may need to give evidence, seek advice or report
crimes. The police are HUMAN and, above all, trying to ensure that the laws of the country are upheld. Their job is stressful and sometimes leaves
little scope for humour.

Problems do occur in heated situations, which may lead to arrest or detainment. You should consider a few points about dealing with the police.

-   Stay calm and cool, quiet and respectful.
-   Watch what you say—it really will be used 'in evidence'.
-   Don't argue, don't make jokes and don't wave your hands about. All of these may go wildly 'wrong' and the situation may
    escalate.

#### Access/search

-   If police officers come to your house, even if they are in plain clothes, they carry full identification—usually including a photograph.
    You have a right, in most cases, to take the identification and telephone the police station for verification. There ARE criminals who
    masquerade as police officers.
-   Always note uniforms, insignia and officer number (usually found on the shoulder or epaulette, or on the ID card of plain-clothes officers).
-   You can refuse to be searched, but the police have a right to search you (or your vehicle) if: they have a warrant; they suspect that you may
    be in possession of offensive weapons or items intended to help you commit theft/burglary; they believe that you may be in possession of
    illegal drugs/substances or stolen goods.
-   The police may enter your home without a warrant (and use reasonable force to gain entry) if they have a warrant to arrest someone or,
    occasionally, to arrest without a warrant for a serious crime.
-   If you are not under suspicion, it is up to you whether you let a police officer into your home. If you do, you may ask them to leave at any
    time.
-   They may search your home if there is evidence that a serious offence has been committed or that you may be in possession of stolen goods. If
    you are arrested, they may search for items which may assist escape or which may provide evidence that you have committed an offence.
-   They may take items away from you—for evidence or to prevent damage or injury.

:::info[TYPES OF PHYSICAL SEARCH]

The simplest type of search is the 'frisk' or outer garment search. It is usually quick and simple. Don't be clever or difficult.
A strip search MUST be conducted at a police station. It must be performed by a member of the same sex (or by a qualified doctor or nurse).

An intimate body search, involving inspection of body orifices, must be authorized by a superintendent, and should be to search for
'hard' drugs or weapons/blades which might be used to cause injury. Intimate searches should be conducted under medical supervision.

:::

#### Arrest

If you are caught up in a situation that involves the police treating you as a suspect, it is essential to know the basics of the laws which
govern the process—and your rights. If you can speak/understand a certain amount of police language, you may be able to ask the right
questions:

-   A police officer may arrest you without warrant if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an arrestable offence is being or has been
    committed.
-   OR if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that you were about to commit an arrestable offence.
-   OR if you were clearly about to commit an arrestable offence. A suspect MUST be informed that he/she is under arrest-and the grounds
    (reasons)—as soon as possible. Giving this information to you will be difficult if you are shouting or fighting, for instance.
-   A police officer must take a suspect to a police station as soon as possible. A suspect has a right to inform someone (directly or indirectly)
    of the arrest.
-   A suspect may consult a solicitor, but if the offence is serious, the police may delay this for 36 hours (the maximum length of time a suspect
    can be held without going to a magistrates' court, unless suspected of terrorist activity). A solicitor should attend any court hearing.
-   You don't have to answer questions. If you feel you have been wrongly arrested—you have a right to say so. Whatever you
    say—even to protest innocence—will be noted.
-   If the police decide to charge you, they must tell you so. You need not answer any further questions and can expect to be allowed to consult a
    solicitor.
-   The suspect should be told if he or she is being charged, detained to provide further evidence or released.
-   In most cases you have a right to one phone call. If this is to an anxious parent or a solicitor, there should be no problem. Evidence does
    suggest that it is not always easy to make the telephone call successfully.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If you are NOT under arrest but only 'helping with enquiries' you do not have to stay with an arresting officer and you should have
this explained to you. In most cases you will come to no harm if you comply. You may have a very real need to be somewhere else, but could
arrange to visit the police station at a later time.

:::

:::danger[WARNING]

If you do not comply with the police when arrested, they are entitled to use reasonable force! You can be fined or imprisoned for
'resisting arrest' or 'obstructing a police officer'-even if you are found innocent of the offence for which you were
arrested.

:::

#### Statements/confessions

DON'T make or sign statements if you are doing so to bring an end to questioning. There are cases on record of people confessing to crimes
they did not commit—sometimes through fear or pressure. This will not help anyone—least of all YOU.

If you do make a statement, confine it to the absolute truth. DON'T sign it until you have read it through and made any changes/corrections.
There may be typing errors which could seriously alter the meaning of the statement.

#### Fingerprinting

In most countries, a record is kept of convictions and the fingerprints of people who have been convicted. Only offences punishable by
imprisonment are usually recorded in this way. The police can only take your fingerprints if:

-   You give your consent, in writing, at a police station.
-   An officer of at least the rank of superintendent authorizes the procedure in writing. Your consent is not required if there are reasonable
    grounds for fingerprinting.
-   The reasons for fingerprinting must be explained to you.
-   If you are charged with an offence, fingerprinting may be done without your consent.
-   Reasonable force may be used to take fingerprints.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

In some countries, including Britain, you may witness the destruction of fingerprints if you are cleared of an offence—as soon as is
practicable.

:::

#### Identity parades

Codes of practice usually require an identity parade where the officer in charge needs to confirm witnesses' reports—or if the suspect
demands an identity parade. You may refuse to take part in an identity parade, although (if suspected) this may prolong questioning and detention.
You may stand anywhere in the parade line-up.

Identity parades should be arranged by an officer who is not involved in the investigation. There should be at least eight people of the same
apparent age, height and general appearance. If there are two suspects, the line-up should involve at least twelve people.

:::info[MISTAKEN IDENTITY]

If ever you are asked to help out by attending an identity parade (not as a suspect) there is NO possibility of your being implicated or
arrested for the offence. The whole idea of the parade is to find out if witnesses can recognize suspects who have been detained. If YOU are
selected by a witness, it proves only that the witness does not recognize the suspect.

:::

#### Bail

If a formal charge is made against you, you must be given a written copy of it by the arresting police station. At this point you will either be
granted bail and released, or taken into custody by the police until the date of the court appearance. Even if you have been refused bail by the
police, you still have the right to ask the magistrates' court to overrule the decision.

#### Finding a solicitor

In theory you do not have to have a solicitor—you can represent yourself. However, when faced with judge and jury and the evidence against
you, you may find yourself ill-equipped to make your own case. You must seek professional advice if you don't want a prolonged stay at Her
Majesty's pleasure.

Finding a criminal lawyer is no more difficult than locating a solicitor to handle a house purchase. Recommendation from a friend or bank manager
is always a good starting point, otherwise a consumer advice centre should be able to help. Legal aid is available for anyone on a low income.

### BEING A WITNESS

Whatever information you give MUST be as accurate as possible. Look at the following lists and see the choices for describing a person. Try to
form a 'word picture' of someone known to you and a friend. Try describing them and see if the friend knows who you mean.

:::info[DESCRIBING A PERSON]

SEX: Male or female

AGE (or apparent age): This can often be difficult to assess and witnesses of different ages may 'see' the suspect quite differently

HEIGHT AND BUILD: Tall, short, medium height, heavy, light, stocky, skinny, athletic, chubby, fat

COMPLEXION: Skin colour, spots, scars, birthmarks, moles, warts, moustache, beard, sideburns, fresh-faced, dirty

HAIR: Colour, short or long, curly or straight, clean or greasy, receding hairline, balding, bald

EYES: Colour, glasses, cross-eyed, one-eyed

EYEBROWS: Heavy/light, missing, meet in the middle

SHAPE OF FACE: Round, square, long, thin, fat, wide, triangular

CLOTHES: Colours, garments, lettering, patches, missing buttons, shoes, boots, gloves, neat, tidy, scruffy, shoes, trainers, boots, workwear,
uniform

JEWELLERY OR TATTOOS: May have names or initials showing, rings, bracelets, earrings, necklaces, badges

VOICE: Loud, soft, deep, high, accent, impediment (speech defect), breathless, angry, calm, use of words repeated, unusual use of words,
intelligent, unintelligent

If you can give some of the above details, you may be able to elaborate as you form a mental picture of the person. Did he/she walk with a
limp? Was he/she carrying anything? If the person ran off, in which direction?

:::

#### Vehicle description

You may see a suspicious vehicle, or a 'getaway' car used by a thief or an attacker. Try to remember:

-   Type of car/van/lorry/motorcycle/bicycle
-   Colour—one or more, writing, stripes, stickers
-   Licence plate number
-   Roof rack, towbar, foglamps, aerial
-   Condition of car—damaged, scratches, dents
-   Details about occupants (number/appearance)
-   Direction of travel

## **UNDER ATTACK**

The majority of crimes are committed against property, usually homes and cars, but the number of reported physical attacks is on the increase.
Contrary to reports you may read in the newspapers, street crime in cities is not a new phenomenon—but it has become more common in recent
years to report crimes and for statistics to be recorded and assessed. Statistics help us identify high-risk groups, times of day and places where
most crimes take place—and precautions people should take to reduce the risk of attack.

Most attacks on the streets are (statistically) committed by young men—usually on their own. The most dangerous time is from mid-evening to
early morning—especially in the summer. A lot of violent crimes are related to alcohol consumption, and happen when public houses and
nightclubs are closing.

#### Violence

It's impossible to explain or understand fully why acts of violence are so common. Robbery as a motive is on the increase—cities combine
the very rich with the very poor. Unemployment and poor housing accentuate the problems. Sexual crimes, including rape, have always taken
place—and often the aggressors are known to the victim already. Members of minority groups may be victims of otherwise 'motiveless'
violence—simply because they ARE members of minority groups. It's always possible that there is no real motive. The attacker may be
genuinely mentally ill.

Most street crime injuries involve bruising, broken noses, black eyes, grazes and shock. With aftercare and counselling, many victims
'recover'. But the alarming increase of crimes involving knives and firearms may mean an increase in the number of victims who die.

Most attacks take place in a few moments. The police can do little except arrange for the care of the victims and take statements from witnesses.
It is up to YOU to make sure that you are not helpless if attacked. It is up to YOU to be aware of your surroundings and to protect yourself. You
must look at self-defence as a real necessity and work out how YOU can minimize the risks of attack.

#### Awareness

Self-defence begins with keeping your eyes open and your mind alert to dangers. Always be aware of your situation and how it might put you at
risk. Look ahead when in the street and be aware of dark corners and alleys, of people loitering, of group of people heading in your direction.
Cross the road if necessary to avoid potential risk. Use your ears too—can you hear footsteps or voices? While focusing on one potential
attacker, you might not be aware that another is behind you. Try to judge situations realistically.

You mustn't start assuming that anyone who approaches you wants to hurt you—but you shouldn't assume they don't. A person
slumped against a wall might be ill or drunk, or could be pretending. A violent argument between a man and woman, followed by cries of help from
the woman, would probably make you want to help—but she might be an accomplice. This puts all of us in a serious dilemma. Most people choose
not to get involved at all.

There are obvious high-risk groups for violent crime. Statistics show a particularly high incidence of attacks on women, the elderly and
children—but everyone is at risk, particularly when alone.

Select from this section whatever suits your needs. Extra advice for women, the elderly and children is given later.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

The knowledge that attacks DO happen is the first step in self-defence. The awareness of a potentially-hazardous situation—expecting the
unexpected—takes us further. But the final step is to equip ourselves mentally and physically to deal with attack or
confrontation—minimizing the physical and emotional damage it may cause.

:::

### ATTACK ON HOME

It's important to understand that not ALL acts of violence occur on the streets. Many occur in the place you feel safest—the home. You
MUST be aware of the kinds of risk involved and take sensible precautions. Attacks may also take place at work or in hotel rooms—places
where you are not usually in total control of security procedures.

At home, it's up to YOU to protect your house and its contents ([see SECURITY](/sas-urban/urban-security)) and—much more important-the
physical safety of you and your family.

#### At the door

NEVER let a stranger into your home. If you arrange for someone, such as a plumber, to call (and it is obviously necessary to admit them) arrange
for another member of the family or a friend to be with you.

-   Fit a door 'viewer' or peephole so you can see the caller.
-   An outside light is essential to see a caller at night.
-   Fit a door chain or limiter so that the door may be opened fractionally, allowing you a better look at the caller, whatever the caller is
    carrying and any accomplices who may be out of sight of the door viewer.
-   Door chains and limiters, and doors for that matter, MUST be strong enough to resist being shouldered or kicked.

Fitting locks, spyholes and door chains/limiters is fairly easy—but not for everyone. Perhaps you could help an elderly neighbour—or
anyone especially at risk. Tell neighbours they can always call you if they are bothered about callers and don't want to be alone with them.

-   Before opening the door at all, if you are on your own, ask the caller what they want. An 'entryphone' is useful—you might
    choose not to open the door at all.
-   Never judge by appearance. Even a child or someone in uniform may be used as a ploy to gain entry to your home.
-   Don't worry about keeping an unknown caller waiting. A door chain or limiter enables you to check the credentials of the caller, by
    telephone to his/her headquarters.
-   ALL official visitors carry identification.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If you're alone, give the impression you have company. When the doorbell rings shout something like: 'Don't worry Tony. I'll
go', 'Take the dog into the kitchen please, Mick'. Even during a conversation with someone at the door, especially if you want to
get rid of them, you could call out, 'Hold on, Johnny, I'll be there in a minute'.

:::

:::danger[WARNING]

If you live alone, DON'T advertise the fact on a label beside your doorbell or 'entryphone'. Add a fictitious name. Women who live
alone should NEVER put Miss, Mrs or Ms in front of their names at the door OR in telephone directories. Doing so has been known to attract
problems. If you use initials, not a first name, no one knows whether you are male or female.

:::

:::info[KEYS]

Your keys—the most obvious means of entry to your home-are YOUR responsibility. You must keep them safe at all times. NEVER put an
address tag on your keys. Always have them ready immediately you reach the door. When you move into a new home—you have no idea how many
people may have keys. Be prepared to change locks:

-   If you lose your keys/your keys are stolen
-   If you give copies to tradesmen to allow them access. When their job is finished, you don't want them 'visiting' you again
-   If the locks are old and worn
-   If you feel you can upgrade the locks. Mortise locks should have at least five levers. Rim locks should have a deadlock facility on the
    inside

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Many rim locks have a replaceable internal barrel containing the lock mechanism. This makes changing the locks fairly easy. Keep the old lock
mechanism. After a couple of years you may need to change locks again-you could reuse the old mechanism. The levers in some mechanisms can be
rearranged and new keys cut to fit.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

NEVER keep spare keys hidden outside your home. You may be seen retrieving the key. Most 'professional' burglars or attackers are
quite capable of imagining the same hiding places.

:::

#### At night

Lock all accessible doors and windows. Close all curtains, especially when undressing or if you have possessions you don't wish to advertise
to everyone who passes by.

If you hear anything which suggests that someone is trying to gain access to your property—or anyone else's, DON'T investigate. Call
the police.

### TELEPHONE NUISANCE

An ex-directory telephone number is a good idea. DON'T be intimidated by random telephone threats or obscene calls. Your rising fear or panic
may be precisely what the caller wishes to hear.

-   Keep a loud whistle by the phone. It could give a nuisance caller quite a surprise!

:::danger[WARNING]

Refuse to be intimidated by telephone calls which only make silly obscene statements. They are unlikely to be followed up. If actual physical
violence is threatened, call the police-especially if the caller seems to know who you are, where you work or routes you take walking to and
from your house.

:::

-   NEVER give your complete telephone number when answering the phone. Some 'telephone attackers' dial randomly until they find a victim.
    If any caller claims they have dialled a wrong number and asks you to tell them what number they have reached, REFUSE.
-   Say instead: 'What number did you dial?'
-   DON'T be drawn into a silly conversation which may degenerate further.
-   Hang up the telephone.
-   Unplugging the telephone (in Britain, at least) means the caller hears a ringing tone and thinks no one is in.
-   If you have more than one call, hang up IMMEDIATELY you realize what is happening.
-   If you suffer from persistent calls, tell the police. It is possible for ALL your calls to be monitored by the telephone company, allowing
    only genuine calls to come through.
-   Special devices are being developed which may be fitted between the telephone and the wall socket to identify a caller's number.
-   You may hear sounds in the background which indicate where the call is coming from. This could help the police.
-   Change your telephone number.
-   Do NOT leave the phone 'off the hook'. This can cause problems with the telephone exchange.
-   You could arrange a signal for friends to let you know they are ringing. They could let the phone ring a certain number of times, hang up and
    ring again.
-   Remove the number label from your telephone to avoid it being seen by anyone who calls at your house and has to be admitted.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Many telephone answering machines can also be used to monitor calls. After your pre-recorded message has been played it is possible to hear
the caller. When you recognize the caller's voice you can pick up the phone-or not. The choice is up to you.

:::

:::info[INTRUDERS]

Apart from the possibility of people entering your home at night, always remember that thieves or attackers may get in while you are out. They
may not be lying in wait, you might simply catch a thief in the act. When returning home ALWAYS check that lights are on or off as expected,
windows, curtains and doors are as you left them.

-   If you do disturb a thief, DON'T block his exit path. You may get hurt in the process. Which is more important—your possessions
    or your life?
-   Phone the police immediately the intruder leaves. If alone, go to a neighbour's house—the intruder may return
-   Try to make a quick mental note of the intruder's appearance and any 'getaway' vehicle
-   If they attempt to physically harm you, use whatever means you can to protect yourself

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Consider installing panic buttons as part of an alarm system. Hand-held screech alarms ([see On the streets](#on-the-streets)) may
also be useful indoors. If you live alone, a simple doorbell could be wired to a friendly neighbour's house to act as an alarm. A powerful
flashlight might dazzle an intruder and could serve as a club for self-defence.

:::

### ON THE STREETS

Most advice given applies especially to people who must be out on their own—although a small group of people may be threatened or set upon.
Attacks are most common on individuals. Most unforeseeable attacks take place:

-   During the summer, usually between the mid-evening and early morning
-   Away from other people, in lonely 'short cuts'
-   From behind
-   When pubs or nightclubs have recently closed
-   On payday—When wage packets might be carried

#### Living in a city

In most large cities there has been a great decline in people's respect and consideration for one another. Many areas may feel like battle
zones to those who don't live there. But even in ordinary day-to-day dealings, people may be very aggressive and self-centred. Many people
live with some level of constant fear of attack or intimidation. Stories of gangs, street crime, vandalism and rape abound and feed these fears.

To add fear to the other stresses people may be forced to live with may make life intolerable. It is essential to replace fear with an increased
awareness or preparedness. DON'T take a passive stance. TAKE POSITIVE ACTION!

Keep yourself fit. Be sensible about moving about on your own. Use your imagination to learn how you might cope in various attack scenarios. Try
to learn some basic self-defence techniques and—most important—enjoy your life! Cities have lots to offer all types of people.
DON'T let fear make you paranoid and overshadow all your activities.

#### When out alone

Plan your routes sensibly. Don't go out for the evening without planning how you will return. Arrange to stay overnight or to travel with a
friend or two. You should feel relatively free to move around as you choose—or you might as well stay at home and barricade the doors and
windows!

Most common sense precautions can become automatic-a normal, necessary part of everyday life just like eating, sleeping or working:

-   Plan ahead. Know the safest route. Carry the phone numbers of a reputable taxi company and enough money to cover the fare. Carry this money
    separately from your other cash.
-   Carry money (or a phonecard) for public telephones. Don't use short cuts across wasteland, down ill-lit alleyways with lots of hiding
    places, through underground walkways, along canal paths, through car parks.
-   If you are driven home by a friend or taxi driver, ask them to wait until you open your door and go inside.
-   Don't display expensive clothes, bags or jewellery—cover them up.
-   Walk facing the traffic to avoid cars pulling up behind you.
-   Avoid eye-to-eye contact as you pass people, but still try to assess their intentions.
-   DON'T look down as if nervous! Hold your head up and look about at all times.
-   At night, on your own in an unpopulated area, don't get close to a car when the driver asks for directions.
-   Don't let ANYONE who approaches you for any reason get within arm's length.
-   Don't accept lifts from strangers-even those claiming to be 'minicabs'.
-   Cross the road if you see a group of people coming down the street towards you.
-   Walking with a large dog—even if you 'borrow' one from a neighbour—should deter most attackers.
-   Look at your shadow on the ground as you walk past a street lamp. If anyone were approaching silently from behind, their shadow might give you
    a second or two's warning.

If you see someone under threat in the street, and don't feel able to intervene, at least call the police at the first opportunity. A group of
people could use their numbers to discourage an attacker.

:::info[BEING FOLLOWED]

If you think someone is following you, cross the street. See if the suspect does the same. If they do, cross back. If they show any sign of
still following you, walk up to a house and fumble with your keys. If it's occupied, ring the doorbell and ask for help. Try to get to a
place where there are other people or stop at a phone and call the police. Go into a shop or, at night, a takeaway restaurant or public house.
If possible, leave by another exit. It may be a good idea to stop and look in a shop window. You may be able to study the behaviour of the
person, reflected in the glass. Try not to panic—don't run unless it is to a place of definite safety nearby.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Going up to a strange house and asking the occupants for help may also be dangerous—especially for a woman on her own. The owners of the
house may not be friendly or may themselves be suspicious or afraid of YOU—an unexpected caller?

:::

If someone comes to your door and says they are being followed or have been attacked, give them the benefit of any doubt. You don't need to
let them into your home-but don't just send them away (which is common). Call the police or an ambulance.

Walking on the road side of a pathway-or even in the road—may be safer when there is no traffic. Don't walk close to doorways and bushes
where all someone has to do is grab you. Make it more difficult for them!

Try to act as if you are very confident (even if you're terrified). Walk purposefully. Keep your hands out of your pockets-ready to use to
defend yourself. Looking confident implies you can 'take care of yourself and may put off an attacker. DON'T keep glancing nervously over
your shoulder. DON'T hang your head and look at the ground. Keep your head UP—looking and listening at all times.

### DRIVING

Being in a moving car—except from the dangers associated with using roads—makes you safer than you might be on foot. But if your car
breaks down, you may become more vulnerable to attack.

Plan your journeys properly, especially through unfamiliar territory. Always have a map handy. Always make sure that your car is working properly
and that you have enough petrol for the journey.

Try to let someone know where you're going, and at what time you can expect to arrive. It would be sensible to join a major breakdown service.
Try to park in busy well-lit areas.

In isolated, unfamiliar or badly-lit areas:

-   Keep doors locked while driving.
-   Keep windows closed.
-   Only stop in an emergency.
-   Don't get out of the car in areas where you wouldn't choose to walk alone—unless you have to.
-   Have a good look round before getting out—don't pull up near dark doorways or bushes.
-   Think (more than) twice before giving a lift to strangers.
-   If you break down, either look for a telephone (unless you have one in your car) or, at night, lock yourself into your car if you feel safer.
    Offers of help may not be genuine.
-   Beware large dimly-lit carparks and multi-storey carparks, especially at night.
-   If you see an accident or someone whose car has broken down—DON'T get out. It may not be genuine.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

It's a good idea to carry a small amount of spare petrol in an approved petrol can. In hot weather, a can of water could prove invaluable.

:::

-   If you think you're being followed—take the simplest route to a busy well-lit area or aim for a police station, a familiar public
    house, a hospital.
-   Don't have valuables in sight in your car. When you stop they may attract someone's attention.
-   If you carry money or valuables on a regular basis—AVOID always using the same route.
-   Never leave any valuables in your car when you park. Lock things out of sight.

If you see an accident or someone having trouble with their car in an isolated spot, you don't need to stop. DON'T get out of the car.
With your doors locked and a window only partially open, drive alongside and offer to phone for help as soon as you reach a telephone (or stop
further on and use a car phone, if you have one). If you prefer, signal to the driver as you pass that you will call for help from the nearest
public telephone.

#### If you are stopped

Someone may step out into the road and make it necessary for you to slow down—or stop. If you haven't already done so, immediately lock
all doors and close windows as you approach. Change to a lower gear—ready to accelerate away if there is any sign of danger. At night, use
your headlights to give you a good view of whatever is happening.

If you must stop, do NOT switch off the engine. Do NOT get out of the car until you are sure there is no danger.

If you really are not sure that the emergency is genuine, drive past—swerving if necessary—and phone the police from the first
telephone you can find. If the emergency WAS genuine, you have atleast summoned help.

### HITCH HIKING

There are dangers from both sides—for the driver and the passenger. As a general rule, hitch hiking alone-especially for a woman, especially
at night—is CRAZY. Equally so is for a person alone in a car to give a lift to a total stranger. Most advice that can be given works both
from the driver's and the hitch hiker's point of view.

Hitch hiking is rare in cities during the day except on exit roads to major destinations. Depending on how you look at life, it's a legitimate
way of getting about if you have no other choice. Unexpected passengers may prevent a driver from being lonely or falling asleep on a long
journey. ALWAYS assess the risks.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Use YOUR COMMON SENSE? Don't hitch hike alone unless you really are confident you can handle any kind of physical threat. Drivers on their
own should NOT pick up passengers. Hitch hiking is not legal everywhere.

:::

#### When driving:

-   A hitch hiker or hitch hikers may be planning to rob a driver or damage/steal the vehicle.
-   It has been known for female passengers to attempt to demand money from male drivers by blackmail.
-   If you give someone a lift and can't get rid of them again-pretend the car has broken down, as realistically as possible. Choose a busy
    location.
-   If threatened with a knife or other weapon, it may be wise to do whatever they ask.
-   A risky tactic may be - if the road surface is good and there are no vehicles behind you—to slam your brakes on and do an 'emergency
    stop', in a bid to escape.

#### When hitch hiking

-   It's very common for women hitch hiking alone to be expected to submit to some form of sexual act 'in return for' being a
    passenger in a vehicle.
-   Men driving on their own have been known to overpower and abuse more than one female passenger at a time.
-   A lot of modern cars have central locking (all the doors can be locked at once by the driver) or childproof locks which can only be opened
    from the outside.
-   NEVER sit between two strangers in a car.
-   ALWAYS make sure you can reach and open a door.
-   If a car stops to give you a lift and you don't feel at all sure about accepting the lift, say that you've changed your mind.
-   Take the number of a car whose driver threatens you in any way and report the incident to the police.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

In most countries the police are not very sympathetic towards women who hitch hike alone. It may be unfair, but they are considered to have
taken an unnecessary risk.

:::

:::info[TAXIS]

When ordering a taxi, always ask WHEN the taxi will arrive. If necessary, the taxi company will phone you when the vehicle is outside your
house. Ask for the driver's name. NEVER get in a taxi alone if you are not sure it is the one you ordered. All this sound fairly extreme,
but many taxi companies use simple radio systems. It is possible that messages could be intercepted.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

In some cities there are special taxi services for women and children-mostly at night. Most taxi companies will be sympathetic to your
concerns if they want your business.

:::

### PUBLIC TRANSPORT

Robbery and assault are common on public transport and are becoming increasingly so. Attack reports confirm that the people who commit these
crimes are becoming more and more daring. Most cities have buses, underground trains, overground trains or trams. Despite the difficulty of being
unable to get off between stops in some cases, there are some attackers who seem quite prepared to try ANYTHING?

Most attacks occur on routes going away from the city or town centre, particularly in the evening. 'Steaming' is a relatively new
phenomenon—a gang proceed through an underground train, train or bus and rob everyone along the way. Such gangs are usually
armed—often with knives—and as soon as they can, they jump off and 'disappear'.

#### Avoiding risks

Travelling late at night after an evening out (when you might be expensively dressed), after working a late shift (when you are probably tired and
less alert than usual)-for whatever reason—puts you at risk. Attacks DO occur at peak times, but more commonly in the later
evening—especially as transport leaves the main central city area. Alcohol and drunkenness are often contributory factors.

-   If unexpectedly working late, try to arrange a lift with a friend or to travel with another person.
-   Sit as near as possible to the driver of trains/buses (NOT upstairs on double-decker buses).
-   On trains and underground trains, sit as close to the conductor/guard as possible, when there is one.
-   ALWAYS choose a compartment with lots of people in it.
-   Be a 'grey' person—don't draw attention to yourself.
-   If your compartment empties—move to a busy one.
-   Women alone should sit close to other women.

:::info[ALARMS]

-   Look for the emergency alarm. Stay near it.
-   On underground trains, DON'T use the emergency alarm between stations. The train is unlikely to stop in a tunnel, making it impossible
    to get out, but may stop PARTLY in a tunnel.
-   Use the emergency alarm on an overground train in a station, if possible.
-   If a bus does not have an alarm button, opening an emergency door usually sounds a buzzer to the driver.

:::

-   Use interconnecting carriage doors if necessary to avoid an attack when a train is not at a station.
-   Choose the busiest sections of station platforms—try to move around (especially when in underground passages) near a crowd of people.

#### Be ALERT!

-   Avoid eye-to-eye contact with ANY stranger who appears to be 'looking for trouble'.
-   DON'T keep your gaze nervously fixed on the floor. Keep your head up and appear ALERT.
-   Pretend to read—but DON'T get engrossed. You MUST be aware at all times.
-   If you wear a personal stereo, keep the volume low enough to allow you to hear what is happening around you.
-   If you are not sitting down, stand where no one can approach you from behind.
-   At a station or stop, scan new passengers as they get on.

If you see someone being attacked or threatened on public transport, at least raise the alarm or fetch help if you don't feel you can
intervene. If someone cries for help, you MUST do something.

:::info[GUARDIAN ANGELS]

<div class="text-center">
![ ](/images/img214_002.jpg)
</div>

The Guardian Angels are a voluntary safety patrol, formed in New York in 1979. By the time a group was formed in London in May 1989, there were groups in
86 cities in the US. The American groups tend to remain fairly detached. In teams, they patrol (mainly) the underground rail network, riding
trains usually one to a compartment—keeping contact with one another to check that all is well. In the UK, they work in much the same
way—but prefer to communicate with the public. In their first 18 months in London they handled about 400 incidents.

Although they were met initially with some opposition from the authorities, this relationship has improved with time—now it is
understood that the Angels have the interests of the public at heart.

Guardian Angels always wear a red beret and a white T-shirt with a large red logo on the front. Jackets, when worn, are red with a large white
logo on the back and a smaller white logo on the chest. To many people who are not used to them, they may at first appear to be intimidating.

#### HOW THEY HELP

The Angels have a code of conduct, which should be stressed. They NEVER refuse to help and NEVER walk away from a problem. They will stop
fights, disperse people and even make 'arrests'—calling the police if a serious injury occurs or weapons are involved. They are
happy to give directions or first aid. They carry phone numbers of crisis centres, hostels and help groups.

Their policy is to recruit women and men of all races, who are not necessarily big or strong-looking—but possess 'the Angel
spirit'. They are trained in close-quarter combat. They do get hurt—sometimes seriously.

#### ADVICE FROM THE ANGELS

Most have jobs and work voluntary 'shifts'. They organize self-defence training and are looking towards community projects—but
their main advice is more immediate. It concerns your attitude:

-   Criminals look for weakness. Let your body language say that you are strong. Stand tall. Keep your head up. Stay ALERT.
-   Believe you have a right to travel without fear of attack.
-   Prepare mentally and physically to fight back. Get angry. Take the initiative. DON'T be weak and let an attacker call the shots.

#### DARE TO CARE

The Guardian Angels can be expected to spread further afield, to other cities in other countries—look for them in Sydney, Paris or
Amsterdam. Public opinion regarding the Angels fluctuates—but which is more worrying to you: the existence of a group of people who are
trying to help OR the fact that there is a need for such a group? As the Angels say—DARE TO CARE.

:::

:::danger[WARNING]

Sit with both feet on the floor. If a problem begins to develop STAND UP. It is almost impossible to defend yourself from a sitting position,
especially with your legs crossed.

:::

#### Stations/terminals

All sorts of crimes from opportunistic bag snatching to abduction take place at main city stations and large travel terminals, especially at
night.

Most genuine travellers are preoccupied with the difficulties of travelling with luggage, more so when in unfamiliar territory. They may be tired
from a long journey, or, as first time visitors, bewildered by the city.

Unattended luggage is likely to be stolen or removed as a suspected terrorist device. In some countries 'suspected' unattended luggage is
destroyed!

All sorts of ploys are used to separate people from their bags. Keep your wits about you. Offers of help are unlikely to be genuine. Someone may
ask you if you are looking for a job, or a bed for the night. USE YOUR COMMON SENSE!

If you have run away from home or have decided to try living in a big city for the first time, be observant and try not to get 'involved'
with strangers. Above all, DON'T arrive without money or plans for where you will stay or what you will do with your time. There are help and
counselling centres. The police will help you locate these.

### MUGGING

Muggers may work in many ways. Most prey on victims who are smaller or appear weaker than themselves. A threat is made and money demanded. They
may not speak at all—only 'pounce' on a victim and take money, jewellery and valuables by force. If faced, however, by muggers with
a knife or a gun—give them your valuables. Which is more important—your possessions or your life?

-   Avoid outward shows of wealth-jewellery (especially gold chains which may be snatched from the neck), expensive clothes/bags, cameras.
-   Don't carry ALL your cash in one place or in your bag.
-   When alone in the street or on public transport follow all the rules already given.
-   Some muggers seek out victims on likely paydays. Try to avoid carrying your wage packet home.
-   Don't carry cheque books/credit cards/cash all together-separate them.
-   Take out only as much money as you need-banknotes could be kept in a moneybelt and change in a pocket or bag.
-   Keep your keys separate-if you lose means of identification (such as your driving licence) AND your keys, CHANGE YOUR LOCKS as soon as
    possible.
-   Carry 'spare' money you can give to muggers. They will think it is all you have.
-   If anyone asks you for change—or if you give money to someone 'begging' in the street, do NOT take out all your money. Carry
    spare change in a pocket.
-   Some muggers operate on public transport by grabbing a necklace or bag and leaping off. DON'T sit close to the door.

### BAG SNATCHING

Apart from the dangers of losing unattended luggage, some thieves operate by snatching bags (often in crowded places) and running off. A shoulder
bag is a good idea, but wear the strap diagonally across your body so you can always see it—NOT just hanging on one shoulder.

Women are the main targets. The thief (who could be male or female) can expect to find cash, cheque book, credit cards, keys,
identification—EVERYTHING. If you carry a bag, keep money, credit cards or keys in your pockets or in a moneybelt.

-   Carry your bag on the side AWAY from a road. There are drive-by bag snatchers-even cyclists and motor cyclists!
-   If your bag is snatched, DON'T try to tackle the thief—he/ she may be armed.
-   Shout 'HELP!' and 'POLICE!' and 'BAG SNATCHER!' Someone may help you (if you're lucky).
-   If someone picks up your luggage shout 'HEY, YOU!' and run towards them. If the luggage is/looks heavy, the thief will realize they
    will be unable to make a quick getaway.
-   Bag snatchers usually head for isolated back streets to investigate the bags they have stolen. DON'T FOLLOW!
-   Some bag snatchers use knives to cut bag straps. DON'T tangle with them.
-   If it comes to a struggle—let the bag go!
-   Bags left by automatic doors on public transport may be snatched—often just as the doors are closing.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

If you carry EVERYTHING in one bag—your money, identification, keys, cheque book, credit cards—then you will lose EVERYTHING in
one go?

:::

:::info[TOILETS]

When using public lavatories, if there is a gap beneath the door, keep your feet tucked in—don't stretch them out. A very rare form
of attack is for people's feet to be grabbed and pulled, causing them to fall off the toilet? The door is then kicked in and they are
robbed.

-   Only use public toilets when absolutely necessary.
-   Use toilets in shops, restaurants, public houses, trains—anywhere you can.
-   If anything—a coin, a roll of toilet paper, a glove—appears under the partition between cubicles, kick it back with your foot.
    Do NOT bend down to pass it back with your hand. While you do so someone may reach over the partition and steal your coat or bag from the
    hook on the door.

:::

:::info[PUBLIC PHONES]

When you use public telephones, always keep an eye on—or preferably, keep hold of—your belongings. At night, beware of people
approaching from behind—especially if you are using a telephone in a kiosk or booth which would restrict your escape. If nothing else is
handy, use the phone as a weapon to defend yourself. Go for the attacker's face. If you're in a phone box and someone appears to be
loitering (not just waiting to use the phone), call the police.

:::

### PICKPOCKETS

Most of us have seen pickpockets operating in the movies, or even magicians performing a very clever 'sleight of hand'. Pickpockets may be
clumsy opportunists—similar to bag snatchers—or they may be extremely clever and organized thieves. Some work alone, others may have
accomplices who distract you in some way. Some are quite capable of removing watches, rings and jewellery—and taking wallets/cheque
books/credit cards from obvious pockets is child's play.

Pockets and bags which fasten with zips or buttons are a good idea, although not 100 per cent secure. 'Velcro' (press tape fastenings) are
unlikely to be opened without your knowing what's going on. You may hear them being pulled apart.

-   NEVER 'wear' your wallet in an exposed back pocket!
-   Avoid crowds—if you can't, make sure you keep your wits about you. If you carry a bag, keep it in front of you.
-   Don't join crowds around street gamblers or casual street salesmen. Pickpockets may work with them to remove more of your
    possessions/cash!
-   If someone bumps heavily and rudely into you, causing you to ricochet off onto a 'kinder' person who smoothes your clothes, touches
    you very reassuringly and asks if you are OK before melting quickly into the crowd, you have probably just been robbed.
-   'Domestic' arguments may be staged—as you go to help (or stare in amazement) you are NOT concentrating.
-   USE YOUR COMMON SENSE! Be aware of yourself and your surroundings at ALL times.

### RAPE

A lot has been written about rape—a very common crime which has been known to ruin lives. Under half of reported cases of rape of women are
perpetrated by men who are total strangers to the victim. Most involve men who are slightly or even well-known to the victim—rape can and
does occur within 'relationships' and marriage. Many cases of rape are not reported—sometimes through great embarrassment or genuine
fear that the authorities may be unsympathetic.

In some countries—the US for example—a rape may be considered 'self-precipitated' if a woman has (for any reason) exposed
herself to risk. Rape and the after-effects of rape are terribly complicated.

There are usually two widely different accounts as to how the event took place. Women must try very hard NOT to develop the feeling that 'all
men are rapists!' This, like being too frightened of muggers to set foot outside your home, is no way to live. Women must try to take the
initiative, by maintaining a positive attitude, staying alert and avoiding situations which involve risk.

A lot of the preceding advice already given in this chapter is relevant here, but there are more points to consider:

-   Many rapes are NOT spontaneous. They may be planned, for instance, by a man who knows or casually 'knows' the victim or regularly sees
    her walking to and from work.
-   Rape may occur as a 'last resort' in an argument—even within marriage. Such rape should also be reported, especially if very
    violent. 'Domestic' violence could easily escalate. If rape is used as a 'last resort'—what is the next stage? Further
    bodily harm?
-   Rape is more common in summer than in winter, and—like any 'street' attack—at night. The chances of outdoor and indoor
    attack are equal.
-   Many attacks occur in the rapist's or the victim's home.
-   Always check lifts before entering. If you live in a block of flats, don't travel in a lift at night. If a stranger gets in with you, keep
    within reach of the alarm button. Avoid eye-to-eye contact. Be polite, but not friendly if forced to speak.
-   Many men cannot tell the difference (it seems) between friendliness and sexual invitations. If in doubt, you must avoid the company of men
    (especially when alone) or try to develop a fairly firm, 'cold' way of dealing with them.

:::info[IF AN ATTACK SEEMS LIKELY]

You must try to think clearly and act quickly. Assess your potential attacker. Is he armed? Is he drunk? Is he strong? Could you reason with
him?

-   Use avoidance ploys or simple self-defence techniques outlined later.
-   Buy time. Try to adopt a calm, confident manner. Invite him to your home promising whatever you think will please him.
-   DON'T actually take him home (but keep him believing that you are). Lead him to a busy area, run to the nearest point of
    safety—an off licence, a wine bar, a public house. Scream if you think it's necessary to call attention to the potential
    attacker.
-   Arrange to meet him another time. Make him believe you mean it. Give him a false telephone number.
-   If he appears to be losing interest, keep chatting to him to distract him from his purpose.

:::

Many women are (understandably) nervous on their own in cities. A woman may be frightened if you stare (even admiringly) or try to strike up a
conversation in a lonely spot. If you spot a woman alone on public transport, DON'T sit close to her. You CAN tell if you are making someone
nervous by walking behind them. Cross the street to allay their fears. If you give a woman real cause for fear, she may take steps to defend
herself.

#### During a violent assault

-   You are being hurt already. Use as much violence as you can without making your situation worse.
-   Bite.
-   If you can reach the man's testicles—grab, twist and pull. He may at first think you are 'responding' favourably.
-   Try and tear out hair, pull off a button, tear off a shred of fabric or fluff from a jumper—anything which might lead to the
    identification of your attacker.

:::danger[WARNING]

If the assault is particularly violent and the attacker is armed or very strong, it may be safer not to struggle.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

The law allows you to use reasonable force to defend yourself (using some of the simple techniques and improvised weapons outlined later). You
may NOT carry weapons for self-defence. In Britain 'mace' sprays are illegal-but there are lots of other things you can do.

:::

#### If you are raped/sexually assaulted

Seek medical attention as soon as possible. Even though it may be difficult to restrain yourself, do NOT wash or change your clothes until you
have been examined. DON'T have an alcoholic drink or a sedative. Try to get a friend to accompany you.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

In some countries, including Britain, your anonymity is usually protected and your sex life should not be the subject of open discussion in
court. In the case of rape by a friend or relative it is NOT necessary to go as far as prosecution. A court order can ban the offender (even
your husband) from having further contact with you.

:::

There are rape crisis centres in most cities which will help victims through what is generally considered to be the ordeal of giving statements,
being examined and questioned.

There is no doubt the police should be involved, but many cases of rape involving friends, husbands of friends or members of the family may have
devastating repercussions on many lives when the truth is discovered. Needless to say, many cases of rape go unreported for this reason. Women may
live for years in emotional torment and may have physical injuries which should be treated immediately. Never forget that sooner or later you may
need to be examined for pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.

:::info[MEN AS VICTIMS]

Men may also be victims of assault, domestic violence or violent sexual assault. The aggressors may be other men or women. So rarely are these
crimes reported fully that investigations are rare and statistics very hazy. Many cases involve more than one aggressor and weapons.
Tragically for the victims, most cultures do not even accept the idea of male rape. Evidence does suggest that the same sort of attack
scenarios occur as for female rape and that the physical and emotional damage may be just as devastating.

:::

### MULTIPLE ATTACKERS

It is virtually impossible for anyone to cope with more than one attacker at a time. You will be overpowered easily. If you can fight, try to hurt
the 'ringleader'—if he goes down the others may hesitate, giving you the chance to escape.

Keep moving—don't let anyone hold you. Use your natural weapons and look for anything you can use. Shout for help. Shout for someone to
ring the police. Try to run to a busy area.

It may make the attackers give up if you fall to the ground and go limp, especially if you are middle-aged or elderly and they think you have had
a 'heart attack'.

If all they want is your money—give it to them. You may escape without injury.

### CAUGHT IN A CROWD

When a crowd panics, or is angry, it can be extremely dangerous. You may be a part of the crowd, and its mood may change—especially true of
sports spectators. You may visit a part of the city, unaware that a political demonstration is taking place. The main dangers are falling to the
ground and being trampled, or of being crushed as the crowd presses in.

#### Danger areas

Avoid crowds where there may be a risk of unrest or take extra precautions to minimize risks at sporting events (indoors or outdoors), political
demonstrations, large queues, industrial disputes. Crowds are usually well managed, but if the road narrows or there are steps or obstructions,
try to get away. Any large body of people, in a rock concert, a cinema, a theatre or a sports stadium can be dangerous if panic breaks out for any
reason—a fire or a fight, perhaps.

#### Be prepared

When you arrive at a large event, look for the safest exit route—indoors or outdoors. Stay away from the centre of large crowds. Near the
stage or a barrier, you may be crushed if the crowd surges forwards. If there is no obvious exit, look for a safe haven—under stairs in a
stadium, under the stage.

Indoors, the way you came in may not be the best way out. Don't leave with the main crowd, especially if 'rival' spectators will
mingle as they leave—hang behind or leave early. If leaving a sporting event, beware of displaying the colours of either team.

If you live near a sports venue, memorize the least popular routes taken by visiting crowds to and from public transport.

#### If you cannot avoid contact

Don't panic. Keep calm. Gradually edge your way out of the crowds. At all costs—stay on your feet. Don't let the crowd push you
towards windows, walls, pillars or steps.

Either fold your arms, with your elbows drawn in tightly, or held out in front of you to create a space. In a tight crush, the danger is that you
may overbalance if you can't reposition your feet under your centre of gravity as the crowd surges.

It may be worth trying to hold onto an immovable object, to resist the flow of the crowd.

#### If you fall

Curl yourself tightly into a ball. Pull your head to your knees and keep your hands clasped round it. Crawl or wriggle, if you can, to the base of
an obstruction such as a car or a tree where the crowd must separate—or at the base of a wall.

#### Driving in a crowd

If you are approaching a large crowd on a bicycle or motorcycle or in a car—stop and change direction immediately. If you are engulfed, when
in a car, turn off the engine. Lock doors and windows. There is a danger that members of the crowd may climb onto your car, break the windows or
even try to turn the car over. If you have a chance, leave the car and head for safety.

## **HIGH-RISK GROUPS**

Attack and assault, whatever the motive, will always rely on the assumed vulnerability of the victim—and some groups have always been seen
as easy targets. According to statistics, children, young people, women and old people all fall into the high-risk bracket. So whilst the
preceding advice applies to more or less everyone, there are other important factors which should be taken into consideration by the more
vulnerable.

### CHILDREN

Children are at risk both from adults and other children. Most people have difficulty explaining their problems: young children may find it even
more difficult to tell someone that they have been a victim of some forms of abuse or violence. They may not understand that the abuse or violence
is unusual.

-   Encourage children to report whatever happens to them-bullying, encounters with strangers (especially if these encounters happen more than
    once).
-   Encourage children to say NO to strangers.
-   Children must NOT approach a car when it stops, even if the driver only asks directions.
-   Children should be encouraged to believe that THEY own their bodies and it is their right not to be kissed or touched if it upsets them. They
    MUST tell you if someone upsets them in this way, even if it's a relative.
-   Children must NOT accept lifts from strangers.
-   If a child is bullied, he/she should tell you.
-   Tell the child that if a bully demand-money or possessions, they should hand things over and you won't be angry—but they must tell
    you about it.
-   Explain that they can hit, kick or scream at a stranger who wants them to do something with them or take them somewhere, even if the stranger
    offers sweets.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

A child or young person may find it particularly difficult to talk about or describe violent cruelty or sexual abuse—through fear (from
threats by the perpetrator), through embarrassment or through fear of not being believed. Statistically, children and young people are more
likely to be abused by a close relative or a family friend—which can make dealing with the problem extremely difficult.

Abuse can affect the quality of a person's life in later years. It needs to be dealt with very carefully—usually with the help of
specialist counsellors. Actual intercourse is not as common as various forms of sexual assault. There may be no physical proof.

If you are a victim of abuse, you MUST talk to someone—a teacher, a Samaritan, a telephone helpline. An anonymous phone call—even
to the police or the Samaritans—may help you find a special helpline or counselling organization.

If, as a parent, you are told of abuse it may be difficult to deal with—particularly if your partner is implicated. Most counsellors
believe that the safety of the victim is of the highest priority, but will not underestimate the impact that the disclosure may have on the
family.

:::

### YOUNG PEOPLE

You may not like having to be home at a certain time—or always having to tell your parents where you are—but if you find yourself
stuck without the means to get home, or get into other difficulties, how can they help you?

If you go out on your own, use your common sense while out on the streets ([see On the streets](#on-the-streets)). If you can afford a
taxi to get home, ONLY use a registered taxi. Don't accept lifts from 'mini-cabs' or people you don't really know.

Tell your parents where you are going. If, for any reason, you can't get home, call them. It isn't just so that they don't
worry—if you are attacked or left unconscious, where are they supposed to look for you?

If you answer an advertisement in a shop window/a local newspaper for Saturday jobs or babysitting, always take a friend with you. A parent would
have to be a little careless if they will accept you, a total stranger, as a babysitter. Most babysitting is arranged through friends of your
family.

If you are babysitting, don't tell callers (on the phone or at the door) that you are alone. Don't let anyone into the house. Phone home
during the evening to let your parents know that everything is OK.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

You are as much at risk of abuse or attack as any child or adult. Some adults may think you are a child and an easy target. Show them you are
not. Don't be fooled by offers of lifts or work that seem too good to be true. You have to start thinking for yourself. When in doubt,
stick with friends and don't move around the city on your own.

### WOMEN

Women, more than men, may find themselves victims of verbal annoyance, sexual harassment or physical molestation at work or in public places.

:::info[HANDS OFF!]

If you are subjected to physical 'groping'—it may be worth considering a few ways of dealing with it. Most methods rely on
knowing EXACTLY who the perpetrator is—or else you may be accused of assault! You need to be feeling fairly confident to use most of
these responses:

-   Move in such a way as to dislodge the hand which is touching you and give the molester an angry look. Be sure it IS an angry look.
-   Say clearly, but only loud enough to be heard by people in the immediate vicinity, 'Please move your hand away from me'. The usual
    response is embarrassment—the molester may try to plead innocence.
-   If you are not sure who the molester is in a crowd, and you are getting upset, use a louder voice and say, 'I would like whoever is
    touching me to move their hand away NOW'.
-   If you are sure who the molester is—stand on their foot. A heel is good for this. If you hurt them (slightly) plead innocence and
    apologize.
-   Pinch the skin on the back of the molesting hand—a small amount squeezed between two fingernails should do the trick.
-   Adjust your bag or your clothing—make a fuss, move around quite a lot and dislodge the hand roughly.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

You can come off worst in this sort of encounter. Using violence (an umbrella brought up between the offender's legs, for instance) may
lead to violence. Most public-place molesters rely on packed conditions and people being too timid to complain. They are usually easily
embarrassed into keeping their hands to themselves.

:::

No job should include sexual favours or sexual pressure-although attitudes towards what constitutes sexual annoyance vary enormously. Detailed
notes should be kept about such pressure at work and reports given to employers.

Sometimes the result may be little more than a reprimand given to a boss or co-worker—sometimes the loss of a job, even by the victim, may
result. Unfortunately civilization is not as civilized as it should be.

It's important to find a way to deal with harassment-most people are under enough stress without the addition of petty abuse. In
public—often on crowded public transport-quite a few people take advantage of cramped conditions. Some people are able to shrug off such
physical contact.

### THE ELDERLY

If you are reasonably fit and agile, you will obviously stand a better chance. However fit you are, a stout walking stick or umbrella should be
carried at all times. Don't assume that an attacker will necessarily be a young man. Attacks have been perpetrated by women, girls and
children. They see you as easy prey—particularly if you have been to collect money. Most of the previous advice applies to you too.

You should talk to your local Crime Prevention Officer about the safety of your home. Follow all the advice ([see Attack on home](#attack-on-home)).
A door chain or limiter is essential. NEVER let anyone into your home, whatever yarn they may spin to you about needing access. Any official
visitor will carry identification. They WILL hand this over if requested (even through the letterbox). You CAN phone to verify credentials.

Try to keep a good relationship with your neighbours. They may be your first line of defence if they know your habits and can spot when something
is wrong.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

-   NEVER keep savings at home. ALWAYS put them into a savings account
-   YOU may be able to get help in making your home secure. The Crime Prevention Officer will be able to advise you
-   NEVER leave your home without locking the door
-   DON'T believe everything you're told—it doesn't take two people to read an electricity meter or to check for faulty
    plumbing
-   Instal a 'panic alarm button'. It will help if you are attacked or fall ill. Some connect to the phone and call emergency services
    for you

:::

:::danger[WARNING]

If you Do admit people to your home, try to arrange a time when someone else can be with you. If you admit more than one person, one may try
to distract you while the other is stealing from another room. If you are fooled and you have admitted a thief-'having a go' may be
very dangerous.

:::

## **SELF-DEFENCE**

You need to develop some way of defending yourself physically. Some people are naturally strong and aggressive—others, who may be softer,
gentler people, need to learn a few simple 'moves' which can be used in a confrontation. Strength is always a major factor
unfortunately—the stronger person nearly always wins.

Surprise is very important—and can often be the deciding factor in a fight, but a person who has learned and practised fighting techniques
will quite often win. These techniques need to become INSTINCTIVE, if they are to be any use in a defensive situation.

#### Fighting fit

The fitter you are, the faster you can move, the longer you can defend yourself, the greater the power you have to defend yourself and to recover
from a confrontation. Older people may not be very mobile—or have much stamina—so a confrontation MUST be kept as brief as possible. A
woman may not be as strong as a male attacker—and must try to keep physical violence to a minimum.

#### Fear

Fear must be controlled—learning a few defence techniques can help enormously—as power, mobility and coordination may be seriously
affected. If attacked, some people who are very afraid may simply 'freeze'.

Everyone is frightened in a confrontation—this triggers the production of adrenalin which is useful for 'fight' or 'flight'.
Breathing correctly helps us focus our energy and take charge of our bodies. In times of great stress, adrenalin may give us extra
strength—sometimes surprising strength.

### MARTIAL ARTS

There is no one style of defence or fighting that fully covers the needs of the average person. All the martial arts are very effective—most
'self-defence' courses use techniques culled from several types of training. Most require a level of dedication and persistence. Some are
more adaptable for women. Other styles may have added advantages depending on your size and weight.

The Western styles of fighting have led to formalized boxing and wrestling. The Eastern martial arts were developed in climates where people
either wore minimal clothing or else loose clothing which offers good firm holds. A lot of the techniques may be ineffective because of the
padding effect of layers of clothing in colder climates.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Violence breeds violence. What begins as an annoyance or a threat to you, may become physical danger if YOU strike the first blow. You may
cause the situation to escalate to violence—and may be sorry that you did. Be very wary of hitting, slapping or kicking someone who
clearly has a physical advantage over you.

:::

If you have knowledge of any of the formal fighting styles, you will automatically use them—boxers punch, karate experts kick, judo experts
use throws. Use whatever comes naturally and develop it. Use your natural advantages.

Short stocky people are good at grappling as they have a low centre of gravity. Tall people have a longer reach. Shorter people may be able to get
inside the reach of taller people and butt with the head. Most techniques can be tailored to suit your size, age, build and weight.

Ju-jitsu involves some karate-like punches and blocking techniques and many highly-effective throws and holds. Jujitsu forms the basis of many
self-defence courses. It may take years to learn all the techniques or 'tricks'. It does not require great strength, but can be very
effective—particularly for restraining an attacker (although escape may be your first priority). Ju-jitsu is not as lethal as many other
techniques.

Judo is practised mainly as a sport, although there is no doubt that many judo techniques are very good when used for defence. It basically
involves using the force employed by and the weight of your opponent against him or her. It takes a lot of practice and judgement. Ju-jitsu would
probably be more useful for self-defence.

Karate is a discipline for the mind and body—if practised correctly. It involves a lot of ritualized movements and many years of training to
achieve real results. It is extremely effective—and deadly—but it is not for the person who only wants to pick up a few ideas. The
high-powered kicks and strikes could be very useful—but take a lot of practice.

Kung fu includes a variety of types of technique—some harder and more aggressive than others. It attracts many people because it looks so
exciting in kung fu movies. Wing chun techniques, involving low kicks and the defence of the centre of the body—plus the speed which kung fu
teaches you-could be useful, especially in close confrontations.

You should investigate locally to see if self-defence classes are available. Most teachers will let you watch a session and discuss the nature of
the course. You might also investigate tae kwan do, hapkido and aikido. Kendo and Thai boxing are becoming more popular.

:::danger[WARNING]

Just a few lessons at a sell-defence course could be very dangerous-persist! It would be easy to develop a false sense of
security-discovering, when it's too late, that you really haven't learnt anything. Courses should be taken seriously, and followed
through. Real confidence and real ability to defend yourself are worth achieving.

:::

### WARMING UP

As soon as you begin exercising, you will discover your own physical limitations. Once you become fitter your confidence will increase. It really
does help to be able to run, to recover from an attack, to be flexible and have some strength—not just for self-defence (where it is
essential), but also in most areas of life.

Warming up helps us loosen up in order to practise selfdefence skills. It also helps to develop speed, coordination and strength. Planned
exercise—whether weightlifting, running or aerobics—is good for you. Vary the routine so that you don't become too bored. Start by
jogging.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Finding the ideal jogging route isn't always easy. A busy traffic route means you get a hefty dose of smog, but a quiet park could pose a
risk to personal safety. Never jog alone in empty streets or at night.

:::

#### Jogging

-   Keep it nice and easy and on the toes.
-   Punch forwards with each arm at shoulder level, keeping elbows raised in time with your strides.
-   Punch upwards from behind the neck.
-   Turn full circle as you run—right side first.
-   Keep turning—run backwards, always travelling in the same direction.
-   Turn again, left side first.
-   Run forwards again.

Once you settle into the rhythm, you soon find jogging easy. Push yourself by varying the rhythm. Choose a target about 50 metres (about 50 yards)
in front of you and SPRING to it.

:::info[VARIATIONS]

-   Hop on left leg for ten strides
-   Hop on right leg for ten strides
-   Jump with both feet together for ten strides
-   Take 'giant' strides—as far as you can—for ten strides
-   Sprint for ten strides

:::

#### Interval training

Interval training is excellent for improving circulation and breathing. It helps develop 'explosive' techniques—sudden bursts of
energy which are necessary in self-defence.

Mark three lines on the ground about five metres (about five yards) apart. Sprint out to each line in turn—returning to the base line
(nearest to you) each time. As you turn, touch the ground. Don't turn the same way each time—turn sometimes to the left and sometimes to
the right.

:::danger[WARNING]

Before you embark on any fitness or self-defence programme, it is wise to have a medical check-up. Suddenly undertaking strenuous exercise may
be very dangerous if, for instance, you are middle-aged and lead a fairly sedentary lifestyle. Particular care is necessary if you suffer from
any heart or respiratory problems. If you undertake official classes, always let the trainer know about them. Other conditions which may lead
to problems include diabetes, haemophilia, epilepsy, recent head injuries (including concussion) and broken bones.

:::

#### It's never too late?

You need to find a programme of exercises to build your strength and suppleness. It's surprising how quickly we 'stiffen up', if we
don't use our bodies. At school we are encouraged to run about—exercise is organized for us. Most adults find it difficult to run for a
bus!

Fitness has become 'fashionable'—look for a local course aimed at your type of physique. It helps to learn some basic techniques and
exercises. Music makes it more fun—and running or exercising with a friend is less boring.

Yoga provides some very good stretching and bending exercises, with excellent relaxation techniques—but you need speed and coordination too.

:::info[BREATHING/RELAXATION]

Breathing correctly is very important. It is a way of recovering quickly from fatigue, a way of relaxing and a way to overcome fear. It can
also prove highly effective in helping you to control your temper—so that you can make the correct decision in a tricky situation.

Stand upright with the feet apart—the distance between them should be about the width of your shoulders. Put your hands on your hips and
keep your elbows slightly forward.

1. Breathe in through your nose for a count of three. As you breathe in allow your stomach/abdomen to rise and fall, NOT your ribcage.
2. Hold the breath for a count of three, relaxing the body. Exhale through the mouth for a count of three.
3. Continue until relaxed and in full control of your breathing. This process—especially holding the breath and then exhaling
   it—helps us control our bodies.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Try the breathing exercise lying down in a darkened room. Relax your body, bit by bit, starting with the extremities. Imagine the room is
filled with pure clean white light—your body is filled with, dark smoke. Each time you breathe in, you take in the white light. Each
time you exhale, you release the dark smoke.

:::

### AVOIDING VIOLENCE

Most of us would prefer to avoid any kind of physical confrontation. This is natural and healthy. There may be ways you can ward off actual
violence or diffuse a dangerous situation.

#### Assess the situation

Unless someone actually jumps out and attacks you, you may have a chance to prevent a situation from slipping into violence. Look at your
potential attacker. Compare their ' size and weight and apparent strength with your own. Is it likely that the attacker is armed? Look for:

-   Long hair and clothing you could grab.
-   Heavy boots/shoes which might cause serious injury.
-   Friends—yours or the attackers—who may come to your defence or become otherwise involved
-   A red face, flushed with blood, implies that the attacker is not ready for fighting—otherwise the blood would be diverted to the
    muscles.
-   A white, thin-lipped face and 'tight' voice imply that violence is imminent.
-   Follow your instincts. If you have a 'feeling' that there is a problem, then there IS one.
-   A fist shaken at you or emphatic hand gestures, including a lot of pointing, may pre-empt violence.
-   Are you restricted in movement by your clothing-especially by your footwear?
-   Is there anywhere nearby which would give you an advantage? Higher ground?

:::info[PERSONAL SPACE]

Each of us has a personal space all around us. We become uneasy when people enter this space—especially strangers, more so when they
stand behind us. Bullies use this invasion of space to intimidate a victim.

If you are stopped in the street for any reason, keep your distance. This should be at least arm's length. The comfortable distance
between people who are having a conversation varies from culture to culture. The British tend to keep their distance more than other
nationalities.

:::

#### Keep talking

Can you diffuse the situation by using words? Can you pretend not to speak the language or not to understand a potential attacker-even acting a
little 'simple-minded'? Perhaps you could say calmly:

-   There's no need to hit me. If you want my money—here it is.
-   I know you're angry but I don't want to fight you.

When a mugger demands money, he/she may be very nervous. Usually a short demand or a threat is made. Rapists, similarly, may just make short,
sharp statements.

One way of dealing with the situation is to start talking-about yourself, where you're going, about your ill health-which may begin to make
you more of a person. The attacker may start to relate to you more as a person and less as a victim and lose concentration—giving you the
opportunity to escape.

#### Staying calm

Ignore verbal abuse—there is no point in fighting over name-calling. Stand in the on-guard position ([see On guard](#on-guard))
and control your breathing. Staying composed will help you assess the situation and anticipate moves. You must focus on the attacker and what
his/her apparent intentions may be. Be aware of possible accomplices. Don't freeze up!

It may be that there is nothing you can say or do to avoid a physical confrontation.

#### Preparing to fight back

The time to decide how and if you will fight back is NOW. No one can make the decision for you. Evidence suggests that people who have at least
attempted to fight back bear less psychological scars than those who have not tried to defend themselves.

Obviously every situation is different—only you can judge what you must do. If you DO fight back, get angry and give it everything you have.
You don't have to fight fairly—your attacker won't!

During the confrontation, take any opportunity you can to escape, alert the police or reach safety. This isn't weak—it's SENSIBLE!

### PERSONAL ALARMS

You should carry a small personal alarm. Choose one that makes the most piercing unbearable noise possible. An attacker might be very surprised
and scared away-especially if help is likely to be summoned by the noise.

Gas-operated alarms tend to be louder than battery-operated ones. They work off small cylinders of gas, but most only sound for about a minute.
You might not feel that a minute is long enough for your plea for help to be heard. In which case, investigate battery-operated versions.

You must make sure that the alarm you buy can be locked on—it might be knocked from your hand. The alarm must continue to sound if the
device is dropped onto hard ground. If you're not likely to lose hold of the alarm—use it in three to five second bursts for maximum
effect.

Make Sure you operate a gas alarm UPRIGHT. Liquid gas may be released if you operate it upside down and cause cold burns to the skin or render the
alarm ineffective.

Keep the alarm ACCESSIBLE. Have it in your hand or in an easy-to-reach pocket. Test it periodically to be sure it works.

:::danger[WARNING]

A screech alarm will not necessarily keep you safe. In practice it may do more to surprise an attacker, than to summon help. A variety of
alarms were tested in a small alley off one of the busiest streets in central London. Disturbingly-N0 ONE took any notice! People in the
vicinity were , questioned to ascertain their reasons for ignoring the alarms. In most cases, they hadn't heard them, or they didn't
know what the sound meant, or they thought the sound was a car alarm! It's time to learn to defend yourself!

:::

### ACTUAL WEAPONS

You may not, by law in most countries, carry actual weapons to defend yourself. Knives, clubs, guns—even disabling aerosol sprays are
illegal. Always remember that a weapon carried BY you could be used AGAINST you by an unarmed attacker.

In most countries, including Britain, you can only use 'reasonable' force to defend yourself. 'Weapons' may include a
specially-sharpened comb or penknife—but hairspray, umbrellas, flashlight and keys are not considered to be weapons and may be carried.

Pepper, scissors or do-it-yourself tools are in a 'grey' area. You may be perfectly justified in carrying them, but you should be aware
that in certain circumstances they may be viewed as offensive weapons.

:::tip[PLEASE NOTE]

The following self-defence techniques are intended ONLY for self-defence, not for use with the intention to cause real harm. If you employ any
of these techniques there is no guarantee that you will emerge unhurt from a confrontation. [See The law ](#the-law)at the
beginning of this section, which explains that (under the law) you may only use reasonable force to defend yourself. Always remember—if
YOU introduce actual physical violence into a confrontation, YOU may escalate the seriousness of the incident. Violence leads to violence.

:::

### BODY TARGETS

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img225_001.jpg" />
</figure>

#### EYES

The eyes are very sensitive—even a speck of grit in your eye, as most people know, can be extremely painful and immobilize you completely
for a few seconds. Although it is a small target, the socket helps guide a blow into the eye. For a few seconds your attacker may be
defenceless-allowing you to escape or strike at another part of the body.

#### NOSE

The nose is usually prominent enough for you to strike it from several angles. Lifting it from beneath may force the attacker to raise their head,
exposing the throat. A hard blow to the nose is very painful and causes the eyes to water. If a nosebleed starts, the attacker may give up.

#### EARS

The ears are a limited target, but may be grabbed and twisted. They carry a lot of blood, so if torn, will bleed profusely. Cupping your hands and
slapping them smartly over the ears can be very painful. Use as a last resort—it may do permanent damage.

#### THROAT

The throat is a particularly vulnerable area. A blow to the throat can be very painful and also quite dangerous. If the head is lowered, the
throat is protected. Expose it by lifting the nose or pulling back on the hair.

#### NECK

Strangle holds may prevent air from entering the lungs and blood from reaching the brain. Be very careful—too much pressure for too long can
kill! A sharp blow on the back of the neck can stun the recipient of the blow.

#### STOMACH

A large soft area, which is low enough to be attacked by the knee. Trained people keep their stomachs firm, but the majority of people have no
muscle tone at all. If punched or kicked, the attacker may be 'winded' and temporarily incapacitated.

#### SOLAR PLEXUS

At the top of the stomach in the arch made by the ribs is a particularly sensitive area. Punching here will not hurt your hands-but the attacker
may be doubled up.

#### GROIN

The lower abdomen is sensitive, but perhaps most sensitive are a man's testicles. A well-aimed kick or knee will hurt either sex, but a man
may be quite literally brought to his knees by the pain. Grab, twist or pull the testicles. Strike them with a fist, knee or foot.

#### KNEE

The knee joint is very delicate. A well-aimed downward kick might totally immobilize your attacker. A blow to the inside of the knee (between the
legs) is very painful. If you miss, scraping a hard shoe down the front of the shin should also do the trick.

#### KIDNEYS

From behind, any blow in the region of the kidneys is usually effective. It can cause great pain and breathlessness.

There are many other vulnerable parts of the body which can make suitable targets in your defence. All the joints are vulnerable—any hold
which puts strain on one or more is disabling. Fingers can be bent, wrists twisted and elbows locked. If you find any of the nerve points on the
body, they can cause a great deal of discomfort. Use them to effect release from an attacker.

### NATURUAL WEAPONS

Now that you know the targets, you need to learn how to use your natural weapons. The legs are the longest, so they can be used to make attackers
keep their distance. The hands are the fastest weapons, but have the disadvantage of being easily damaged.

:::danger[Warning]

Most people instinctively punch when threatened, but this is not a good technique. If your hand strikes the attacker's head, you could
break a bone in a finger. If you hit their teeth, you may cut your hand and get quite a nasty infection. Your hands can swell up very quickly
and become unusable. Even boxers, who know how to use their hands, are VERY careful about them. They make sure their hands are protected
before a contest. PUNCHING IS FOR SOFT TARGETS ONLY.

:::

#### PUNCH

To punch correctly, you must make a proper fist. Look at your hand, palm up. Starting with the little finger, curl in the fingers one by one,
locking the thumb OVER the fingers. NEVER curl the fingers over the thumb. NEVER let your little finger stick out. If you make a fist incorrectly,
you will hurt yourself more than the person you are hitting.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img226_001.jpg" />
</figure>
The wrist MUST be locked, or you may damage it. The line of the forearm should follow straight to the knuckles.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img226_002.jpg" />
</figure>

A punch should use the whole body—it should come from the legs, through the waist, through the shoulder and finally through the arm. All the
power comes from the legs and the torque effect of the waist. DON'T draw back to punch—it's too slow, it announces the strike and
it's easy to block an expected punch.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img226_003.jpg" />
</figure>

#### HAMMER FIST

The best way to use your fist! Make a fist as before ([see Punch](#punch)). Use it as a hammer wherever you can. Aim for the
attacker's nose, ear—almost any target. You'll find you can deliver quite a blow.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img226_004.jpg" />
</figure>

#### PALM STRIKE

If you were told to punch a wall, you wouldn't use a lot of force—it would hurt. If you hit the wall with a palm strike or hammer fist
you can use quite a lot of force without damaging yourself. The palm strike can be very effective.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img227_001.jpg" />
</figure>

Cock your wrist—angle the hand back slightly on the wrist. Spread the fingers and curl them tightly, holding the thumb in to avoid damaging
it.

Use the heel of the hand or the bottom of the palm to strike the attacker's jaw from below. Keeping the movement close to the attacker's
body means they may not see it coming. If you miss the jaw you will probably hit the nose, which would have been your next target.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img227_002.jpg" />
</figure>
When you have hit the jaw in this way, your fingers can easily find the eyes.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img227_003.jpg" />
</figure>

#### PALM EDGE

The palm edge can be useful for attacking the throat or the back of the neck, although it may not work as well as it does in the movies!

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img227_004.jpg" />
</figure>

#### FINGERS

Use these to attack the face and eyes. They can be flicked out with a minimum of effort and used to gouge. Use them as claws. Open your fingers
slightly from the palm, strike and scratch. Use a 'swinging' movement like a cat or dig in and drag.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img227_005.jpg" />
</figure>

Make the fingers into a chisel point, keeping the thumb tucked safely in, and jab at the philtrum (the upper lip just below the nose), the throat
or the eyes.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img227_006.jpg" />
</figure>

#### FOREARM

The forearm is a hard bony structure and is useful for a 'back hander' to your opponent's face or neck. The attacker may think you are
turning away. When you lash out with a backswing, they are caught off guard. Almost anything that is banned in boxing is good for defence!

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img227_007.jpg" />
</figure>

#### ELBOW

The elbow is one of your best weapons. It delivers a considerable blow—often with maximum power and maximum surprise. Snap it up under the
jaw or nose. Use it if your attacker is in front, to one side or behind you. Disguise the twist of your body as an attempt to get free and bring
the elbow back for all you are worth across the face or under the jaw.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img228_001.jpg" />
</figure>
Extra force is added if you make a fist of your hand, cup the other hand round it and literally push the elbow into the attacker's stomach.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img228_002.jpg" />
</figure>

#### TEETH

If you can get any part of your attacker within range-BITE! Any fleshy part will do. Don't let go. Keep on biting. It may be important,
especially in the case of rape, to mark an attacker.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img228_003.jpg" />
</figure>

#### FEET

An extended leg could keep an attacker away-especially if you are on the ground. If kicking, don't draw the leg back—this announces the
move you are about to make. Take all the weight on the other leg and bend it slightly. Aim the kick to the groin, knee or stomach. Make it a snap
action so that the leg is withdrawn immediately. You musn't let your attacker grab your leg and overbalance you.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img228_004.jpg" />
</figure>
<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img228_005.jpg" />
</figure>

#### SCREAM!

In tight situations, it helps to scream. It offers several advantages. It may summon help. It drives the air out of your body and helps you focus
your energy. It may also shock the attacker. If a real 'bully' finds that you are screaming and lashing out-they may run away.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img229_001.jpg" />
</figure>

#### KNEE

The legs are very powerful and the knee can be used to devastating effect. With practice it can become a very fast weapon. Use for a blow to the
attacker's testicles, stomach or even thigh. One advantage of using knees is that they are well below the eye level. If an attacker runs at
you—raise a hand as if to defend your face. At the last moment, raise a knee so that the attacker runs right into it at testicle height.
Don't look down or you will have 'given the game away'.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img229_002.jpg" />
</figure>
The attacker's head may even come into range-especially if 'doubled up' by a blow to the testicles.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img229_003.jpg" />
</figure>

#### HEAD

If grasped face-to-face by an attacker, quickly snap your head forward to hit the nose with your upper forehead. Shorter people can often butt a
taller person in the solar plexus or stomach.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img229_004.jpg" />
</figure>
If you are grabbed from behind-snap your head back to hit the attacker in the face preferably on the nose.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img229_005.jpg" />
</figure>

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Surprise is all-important. Try to recognize danger and be one step ahead. Run through likely defence techniques if you see a situation
developing where you might need them—BEFORE you are required to defend yourself. Move quickly. Don't draw back the hand or the leg
to strike—the opponent will be able to see it coming.

Use whatever you have to defend yourself:

-   Coins from your pocket can be thrown in an attacker's face
-   Wrap them up in a handkerchief and use as a club
-   Use your bag, purse, briefcase-aim for the head
-   Umbrellas and walking sticks can be used as clubs or jabbed into feet or stomach—or brought up between the legs to an attacker's
    groin
-   Hard-soled shoes are essential to be able to kick effectively. Aim for the groin. Scrape your shoe down a shin
-   High heels should be aimed at an attacker's foot or hand. Putting all her weight on a thin heel means an average woman can exert a
    pressure of nearly three-quarters of a ton!
-   You cannot run in high heels. Take them off and throw them—or use them to strike the attacker
-   A powerful flashlight may dazzle an attacker-and also could make a handy club
-   Grab a handful of dirt, gravel or sand and throw it into the attacker's face
-   Roll up a newspaper and jab it end first into the face or stomach
-   Jab a credit card, comb, hairbrush, anything into the philtrum (the upper lip just below the nose)
-   Scrape a comb across the attacker's face or back of the hand
-   Dig a pen or pencil into the attacker's hand or face-the attacker's impulse may be to defend the eyes
-   Jab or scratch with keys
-   Powder from a compact may temporarily blind an attacker
-   Perfume, hairspray or deodorant can be sprayed into an attacker's eyes

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Disabling sprays are ILLEGAL in most countries, as are knives, clubs and guns. Even a spanner could be considered an offensive weapon if
it's not part of the tools of your trade, and could land you in court. If you're not a plumber, builder or whatever, the inference
could be that you intend to cause someone harm.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Violence breeds violence. An incident that begins with an attacker grabbing your coat and demanding money may escalate into serious assault.
If possible, attempt to deter the attacker without being the first one to use real violence. If your attacker is a lot bigger or stronger than
you, they may be relying on just frightening you. Once real violence is introduced, you may be way out of your depth.

:::

### ON GUARD

To defend yourself against an attacker and use all your natural weapons to the best effect, you need a balanced position from which to fight.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img230_001.jpg" />
</figure>

Stand normally-facing the target. The distance between your feet should be about the width of your shoulders. Your favoured leg should be slightly
forward and your knees should be bent slightly. Tuck your elbows in, protect your head and body by holding your hands in front of you and lower
the chin to protect the throat. You MUST feel comfortable in this position. DON'T strain or stiffen up.

#### MOVING ON GUARD

Try to make your movements flow. Don't move jerkily. NEVER cross the legs or your stable base is lost and you will be knocked off balance.
Practise moving forwards, backwards, to the left and right. Keep the arms up at all times.

Practise with a partner. Don't actually exchange blows. The target is the forehead. If the partner reaches out with a right hand, parry
(deflect or block) with your left—and vice versa. Don't stand still-keep moving at all times.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img231_001.jpg" />
</figure>

:::tip[PLEASE NOTE]

It is impossible to cover every type of attack and recommend defence techniques to deal with them. The following will give you a clearer
picture of the kinds of moves you must make-but no book is a real substitute for taking a self-defence course! Proper training will help you
to learn how to channel and use anger-and control fear. You will also have to match the ruthlessness of an attacker.

:::

### INTO ACTION!

Don't practise any of the following techniques until you have mastered the on-guard position. Start open-hand techniques with the hands up and
open-pleading with the attacker to leave you alone. While this gives them a sense of power or false sense of security, your hands are where you
need them-up and ready for the eye jab.

#### EYE JAB

Flick the hands forward-like a snake striking-extending the fingers. Aim for the eyes. DON'T draw your hand back before you attack. You
don't need much force, the eyes are such a delicate target.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img231_002.jpg" />
</figure>
Defence against the eye jab is to move the head to one side and to use an arm to parry (deflect) the thrust. ALWAYS parry a straight thrust.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img231_003.jpg" />
</figure>

#### CHIN JAB

Use the chin jab when your assailant has thrown a punch. An untrained person will take their arm back and swing the arm. Step into the swing and
parry the blow with your forearm. If the attacker swings with the right hand, parry with your left. Stop the swing and jab upwards under the chin
with the palm of your right hand ([see Palm strike](#palm-strike)). Push right through the target, pushing the head back. If you are
lucky your attacker will fall over backwards and hit the ground.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img232_001.jpg" />
</figure>

From this position you can raise a knee at the same time to strike the attacker in the groin and claw the eyes with the hand you have beneath the
attacker's chin.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img232_002.jpg" />
</figure>
If you miss the chin or the attacker is still standing, grab the hair at the back of the head and pull down hard.

If all these are done quickly, your attacker should go down. You should be able to deliver a chin jab with either hand.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img232_003.jpg" />
</figure>

### ELBOW STRIKE

The elbow can deliver a considerable blow. With the hand held high in a 'pleading' position an elbow can be lifted suddenly to catch the
attacker beneath the chin. Practise this movement so that you could use either elbow. The 'free' hand must be kept up to counter any
return blow.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img232_004.jpg" />
</figure>

### BREAKING HOLDS/STRANGLES

NEVER get in a grappling match with your opponent-it becomes too difficult to use surprise and to strike effectively. Anyone who grabs you from
the front usually brings their groin within range. Use your knee! If pulled towards them, you will not be able to get your balance to kick.

#### ELBOW LOCK

Turn your attacker's hand (with both hands) so that the thumb is downward, locking the wrist at maximum rotation, and the elbow uppermost.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img233_001.jpg" />
</figure>

Bring your arm over the elbow and bear down-forcing the arm straight and locking the elbow joint. Exerting pressure now will hurt a lot and the
attacker may be frightened that you will break their arm.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img233_002.jpg" />
</figure>

#### FRONT STRANGLE

Use your knee to the groin, head butt and kick. If these are ineffective, swing your right arm over your opponent's hands and bring the elbow
back across the arms or chin or strike a 'backhander'. If you can turn to one side in a strangle, you may reduce its effectiveness.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img233_003.jpg" />
</figure>

:::tip[REMEMBER]

When in a stranglehold, try to relax-if at all possible! This makes the stranglehold less effective. When straining, the 'Adam's
apple' is more pronounced and makes the strangle easier. Sinking down (when in a standing position) may also destroy the attacker's
balance.

:::

#### TWO-HANDED GRAB

If someone grabs you with both hands on your chest, throw your arms over theirs and exert pressure downward so that their arms bend. This
automatically makes them drop their head forward—open to a head butt from you.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img233_004.jpg" />
</figure>

#### REAR STRANGLE

If held or strangled from behind, snap your head back into the attacker's face or swing your hips to one side and strike backwards with your
hand at the attacker's groin.

Always do the unexpected. Try to destroy an attacker's balance. If they try to push you forwards, into a car or a dark alleyway perhaps,
resist initially so that they use extra force. Suddenly take a giant stride forwards. If they fall, kick the groin.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img234_001.jpg" />
</figure>

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Try to use an attacker's momentum against them. If someone runs at you, sidestep and use a forearm to the throat. The faster they are
moving the greater your blow will be, although it requires careful timing.

:::

### KICKING TECHNIQUES

The legs are very powerful weapons, but to deliver this power you must keep your balance. A kick must be fast and effective—it must be a
'surprise'. Don't draw the leg back before you kick.

#### Using the knee

The knee is an excellent close-quarter weapon and can be used to great effect. The idea is to drive it THROUGH the target-when aimed at the groin
you should be trying to lift your opponent off the ground. Aim also for the stomach. Keep your hands up, aiming for the attacker's face to
distract them. The opponent's head can be pulled down—perhaps by the hair-and the knee brought up to meet it.

If you are side-on to the attacker, drive the knee hard into the thigh. If you're lucky you will hit a nerve and deliver a 'dead
leg'—which is very painful.

If your attacker tries to wrestle you to the ground, try to twist so that YOU land on the top. Aim to land so that one or both your knees are
driven into their stomach or abdomen.

:::tip[PRACTISE!]

Stand in the on-guard position. Hold your hands out in front of you, side-by-side at waist height. Transfer your weight to one foot,
immediately snap the other knee up into your hands. DON'T lower your hands. Recover at once into the on-guard position. Now adjust your
balance to use the other knee. The action should be fast and recovery immediate. Your knee should smack into the palms of your hands.

:::

#### Using the leg/foot

Kicking also relies on good balance. Surprise and recovery are vital. You must NOT allow the attacker to grab your foot or leg. If you distract
the attacker by spitting, screaming and flailing at the face, the kick will be unexpected.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Balance is vital when kicking. All the weight is transferred temporarily to the anchor leg. Use your hands/arms partly for balance and partly
to distract the attacker by going for the eyes. The hips and waist give a lot of the turning power and thrust to kicks and strikes. PRACTISE!

:::

#### MULE KICK

From the on-guard position, transfer the weight onto one leg, pivoting the hips in that direction. Simultaneously raise the other foot, bending
the leg. Snap the foot out and down, striking the opponent's knee or scraping down the shin, with the side of your foot. Recover immediately
to the on-guard position.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img235_001.jpg" />
</figure>

### KNIFE DEFENCE

:::info[FORCED TO DEAL WITH A KNIFE]

Avoid tangling with someone with a knife unless there is absolutely no way to escape. If you are forced to defend yourself:

-   Keep circling away from a thrust to the stomach and other vulnerable areas. Suck your stomach in.
-   Most knife attacks involve diagonal slashes across face or torso. Keep circling to get out of slashing range.
-   If you get into a tangle with your assailant, you're too close. If you MUST grab something, grab the attacker's wrists with both
    hands.
-   Better still, use mule kick or knee-to-groin to drive the attacker back out of range.
-   Wrap a heavy article of clothing around your hand and forearm to deflect the knife blade.
-   Let the knife impact on a bag or briefcase.
-   Parry the thrust with an umbrella, walking stick or any stout stick (which gives you a longer reach). Go for joints, bones, collarbone,
    knees, wrists.
-   Don't swing a stick. NEVER pull back before you swing—you have just told the attacker what you are about to do.
-   Jab with the end of a stick.
-   Throw dirt in the attacker's face.
-   Keep shouting for help.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Knives are deadly and can inflict serious injuries or kill. Most people freeze when confronted by any weapon-especially anything as serious as
a knife or gun. Avoid confrontations with weapons at all costs. If the weapon is being used as a threat to demand money or goods-hand over
whatever is requested and try to get away. If you are not trained in self-defence, you cannot hope to deal with an armed assailant. Which is
more important-your property or your life? The only real defence against a weapon is a more powerful weapon. A large heavy stick might give
you the advantage against a knife-but not against a gun.

:::

### FIREARM DEFENCE

There is very little defence against an attacker armed with a gun or rifle. Some petty thieves rely on the mere sight of a weapon to be sufficient
to persuade you to do as they wish. They may not even know how to use a gun. Others may be very proficient and very keen to shoot. You cannot
judge whether the gun will be used by accident, in a panic or with cool precision.

Techniques for disarming or grappling with an assailant who is armed with a firearm require a lot of luck, skill and careful timing. Even if you
had a lifetime's training in self-defence, you could not be sure of wrestling a gun or rifle from an attacker's grasp.

:::info[KEEPING YOUR DISTANCE]

The distance between you and your attacker plays a vital part in any confrontation. The distance the attacker needs to punch, kick or use a
knife may influence your choice of defence technique. If in doubt—let fly with everything you have.

-   Punching/striking. The attacker is well within range of kicks.
-   Knife attack. You should still be able to kick.
-   Grappling/strangles. Use palm strikes, claw the face, try mule kicks and head butts, use the knees.
-   Stick attack. Back off or step inside swing, block at the attacker's wrist with your forearms and use your hands/knees as well as you
    can.
-   Firearm attack. Put 50 metres (55 yards) between yourself and the gun-the attacker may be a poor shot. Keep low and don't run in a
    straight line. Aim to put an obstruction in the firing line—a fence, trees, cars.

:::

## **ANIMAL ATTACK**

In the urban environment, it's not only other people that give cause for fear—animal attack is a very real possibility, both from
domestic pets and urbanized wildlife. Even the humble magpie poses a threat in countries such as Australia, making vicious attacks on unsuspecting
passers-by during the egg-laying season.

Dogs, however, remain the biggest threat to the urban dweller. And whilst domestic pets should be reliable, old dogs can become cantankerous,
bitches can get defensive when they've recently had a litter, and some breeds are encouraged to be excessively territorial.

Guard dogs and pets which were originally intended as guard or hunting dogs may have an aggressive streak-even the owners may be at risk. Some
dogs just don't like strangers. Even a friendly animal might take exception to rough treatment. The 'bark' is quite often worse than
the 'bite', but you may be forced to be quite ruthless to defend yourself.

:::info[ATTACKED BY A DOG]

-   Avoid eye-to-eye contact with any 'vicious' animal-especially a dog.
-   Stand still—speak firmly (as the owner might) using clear commands such as 'No?' 'Stay there' or 'Sit?
-   Try using a 'good boy' gentle voice to talk to the dog.
-   If a small dog goes for your ankles-a soft kick may deter it.
-   If the animal jumps up to bite you, offer a well-padded arm—push your arm to the back of the throat. Don't pull back. Give the
    dog a sharp blow on the nose. If you must, go for the eyes. Twist an ear and pull hard.
-   If running or jogging, stop. Walk away before continuing to run.
-   If chased by a dog (or other animal) drop an article of clothing or a bag? It may stop to investigate it.
-   Don't grab any dog by its tail-it can easily bite you.
-   You may be able to pick up a small dog by the scruff of its neck—and deposit it safely on the other side of a fence or wall.

:::

Not everyone likes dogs and some people-especially children-may be terrified if a large dog approaches. If you own a dog, keep it under
control—DON'T let it jump or snap at strangers. NEVER let a dog run free around the neighbourhood. In most countries YOU are liable for
the damage or nuisance 'it may cause.

:::danger[Warning]

Rabies (hydrophobia) is still common in many parts of the world, although Britain and Australia have more or less eradicated it. The dog or
other animal affected may be wild-eyed and foaming at the mouth-but it may not. If you get a large amount of saliva on the skin-or the skin is
broken-seek medical attention immediately. It would help if you could identify the animal ([see here](#dogs)) as rabies is a
horrific and often fatal illness which affects the brain. If bitten, anti-tetanus injections may also be required.

:::

:::info[DOG DETERRENTS]

There are whistles and electronic devices which are sold, claiming to deter dogs. Dogs have much more sensitive hearing than man—and can
hear high frequencies which are beyond our detection. There have always been 'dog whistles' but more recent 'ultrasonic'
battery-operated devices claim to stop dogs in their tracks. In some cases they do work, although real guard dogs are trained to ignore the
sound. These deterrents could be worth investigating.

:::

### URBANIZED WILDLIFE

Depending on where you are in the world, most cities have urbanized wild animals. Most come in to scavenge-and pose little threat unless cornered.
Their natural habitat may have been eroded by civilization, and they may have little choice but to scavenge as a means of survival. Racoons,
bears, wolves, foxes—even leopards—like to raid waste bins.

On a day-to-day basis, rabies is still a major problem throughout much of the world, and capable of infecting anything from monkeys to dogs to
humans. Be very wary of touching a wild animal that appears to be sick or dying and yet is unusually tame. Rabies is a 'clever' virus,
altering normal animal behaviour as a means of spreading the disease. Consequently, a wild animal may become 'tame' and a domestic pet
savage.

Rabies is just one of the many illnesses transmitted by vectors—in other words, disease carriers ([see HEALTH: Zoonoses](/sas-urban/urban-health#zoonoses)).
External and internal parasites also represent attack on a microscopic scale.

## **DOGS**

Most dog breeds were intended for specific purposes: guarding, herding, droving, baiting animals or fighting. These origins can be expected to
affect their temperament. Powerful dogs need training, discipline and regular exercise, or may become dangerous and uncontrollable. Here's a
guide to aid recognition of common types.

1. German shepherd (Alsatian) Versatile guard, used by the police and as a guide dog. Alert and reliable with stamina. Height at shoulder: 66cm
   (26in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_001.jpg" />
</figure>

2. Doberman Developed as a guard in the 1870s. Tough and quick-thinking, but needs careful handling/ training. Can be an anti-social nuisance.
   Height: 68cm (27in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_002.jpg" />
</figure>
3. Rottweiler The heavyweight guard, originally a cattle dog. Widely used by police and military. Height: 68cm (27in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_003.jpg" />
</figure>
4. American pitbull terrier American-bred fighter, extremely strong and very quick. Bred for a low pain threshold. Height: 48cm (19in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_004.jpg" />
</figure>
5. Bull mastiff Well-established guard, although the breed is only a century old. Originally used to pin down poachers. Height: 68cm (27in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_005.jpg" />
</figure>
6. Giant schnauzer Bavarian dog bred for droving cattle and pigs, then used as a police and army dog. Height: about 65cm (25&frac12;in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_006.jpg" />
</figure>
7. Bouvier des Flandres Bred as a cattle drover, makes a fine guard. Normally calm, but formidable when roused. Height: 68cm (27in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_007.jpg" />
</figure>

8. Australian cattle dog An extremely tough working dog, with great endurance. Needs plenty of activity. Could become difficult if restricted by
   city life. Height: 51cm (20in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_008.jpg" />
</figure>
9. Corgi Droving dog, bred to nip the heels of cattle to keep them moving. They take an interest in ankles! Height: 30cm (12in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_009.jpg" />
</figure>

10. Jack Russell terrier Bred (as most terriers) for digging out rabbits and other animals. Small plucky dog, unintimidated by the size of an
    opponent (including humans!). Height: 30cm (l2in).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img237_010.jpg" />

## **POISONOUS SNAKES**

Poisonous snakes are rarely a danger in most cities. Many countries have no poisonous snakes at all. If you are in snake country, always seek
advice and take precautions.

#### EUROPE

Adder Vipera berus The only poisonous snake of northern Europe, it varies from olive-grey to reddish-brown, sometimes with a darker zig-zag
pattern. Timid, but strikes quickly/repeatedly if cornered or alarmed. Length: 30-75cm (12-30in). Bite rarely fatal. Larger and more dangerous
relatives in southern Europe, the eastern Mediterranean and across northern Asia to Korea.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img238_001.jpg" />
</figure>

#### AUSTRALASIA

Death adder Acanthopis antarcticus Thick-bodied and brownish, reddish or grey with darker banding. Well camouflaged, it seldom moves away when
approached but waits for prey to investigate then strikes. Length: 45-60cm (18-24in). Highly venomous. One of Australia's deadliest snakes.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img238_002.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Tiger snake

Notechis scutatus Thickbodied, large-headed, tawny-ochre with greenish-yellow, grey or orange-brown bands. Found from southern Queensland down to
the populous areas of New South Wales (where it's black rather than brown). Nocturnal on warm summer nights. Length: 130-160cm (51-63in).
Aggressive and very poisonous.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img238_003.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Taipan

Oxyuranus scutellatus Uniformly light to dark brown, with yellowish-brown on the sides and belly. Found from the Kimberleys through Arubauland to
Queensland in northern Australia. Length: up to 3.5m (11ft). Shy, but fierce, when aroused and deadly poisonous.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img238_004.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Eastern brown snake

Pseudonaja textilis Found in drier areas of eastern Australia. Slender, yellowish-grey-to-brown with pale belly. Length: 1.5-2m (5-6&frac12;ft).
Active by day. One of several poisonous brown snakes. Very poisonous, easily roused and when antagonized strikes repeatedly.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img238_005.jpg" />
</figure>

#### AFRICA & ASIA

Puff adder Bitis arietans Thick-bodied, short-tailed and large-headed. Straw-brown with darker markings. Found in savannah and semi-arid areas of
Africa and the Arabian peninsula. Well camouflaged, it waits for prey on paths after dark. Length: 90-130cm (35-51in). Highly venomous-causes
extensive internal bleeding. One of many different vipers, which are found all over Africa and Eurasia.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img238_006.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Saw-scaled viper

Echis carinatus Roughscaled, pale-reddish to sandy-brown with darker markings and light blotches. Found in arid areas from western North Africa to
India. Uses serrated scales on its side to make a threatening noise. Length: 40-55cm (16-22in). Vicious, common, many fatalities. Causes death
from internal bleeding.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img238_007.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Russell's viper

Vipera russelli Brownish, with three rows of spots formed of whitebordered black rings, each with a reddishbrown centre. Found in most areas from
east Pakistan to China and Taiwan. Length: 100-120cm (39-47in). Responsible for the highest number of viper bites in the area. Highly venomous.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img238_008.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Malay pit viper

Calloselasma rhodostoma Fawn, reddish or grey marked with geometric patterns. The belly is yellowish or spotted greenish-brown. Found in Southeast
Asia and Indonesia. Length: 60-80cm (24-32in). Bites are common. Dangerously venomous. Has many relatives in the area. Avoid ANY that resemble it.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img238_009.jpg" />
</figure>

#### SAFETY RULES

NEVER tease, pick up or corner a snake. BEWARE an apparently dead snake, some only move to strike when prey is close. STAY CALM If you encounter a
snake, do NOT move suddenly or strike at it. Back off slowly. In most cases the snake will try to escape.

#### Asiatic Cobra

Naja naja When alarmed, has easily recognized raised head and spreading hood—often with markings. Occurs in Asia from Middle East to Far
East. Common in urban areas. Length: 1.5-2m (5-6 1/2ft). Highly-toxic venom.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img239_001.jpg" />
</figure>

#### SPITTING SNAKES

A few cobras spit poison as well as bite. The venom is diluted and therefore not as dangerous, unless the poison reaches an open cut or the eyes.
If it does, immediately wash out thoroughly with water. Seek urgent medical attention.

#### Mamba

Dendroaspis species Smallheaded, very slender, typically with large green or greyish scales. Found in Africa south of the Sahara, usually in
trees. Length: 1.5-2.1m (5-7ft). The large black mamba (D.polylepis) is mostly terrestrial. Length: up to 2.6m (8&frac12;ft). Often quick to
strike, black mambos deliver large doses of venom which affect the brain and head. FATAL unless antivenin given quickly.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img239_002.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Indian krait

Bungarus caeruleus Smallheaded, with black-and-white or black-and yellow bands down the body. Found in India and Sri Lanka. Length: 1.3-2.1m
(4-7ft). Slow to strike, but its venom is especially powerful. Bite is almost painless. Symptoms may take several hours to develop, by which time
it may be too late.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img239_003.jpg" />
</figure>

#### THE AMERICAS

#### Rattlesnake

Crotalus/Sisturus species Chunky body, wide head and a rattle at the end of the tail that is usually, but not always, sounded as a warning. Many
kinds, widespread in the US and Mexico. The largest are the various diamondbacks, with distinctive diamond-shaped blotches. Length: 45cm (18in) to
over 2.1m (7ft). Larger species are especially dangerous.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img239_004.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Copperhead

Agkistrodon contortrix Stout body, coloured buff or orange-brown with rich brown bands and a copper-red head. Found mainly in the eastern US.
Fairly timid, it vibrates its tail if angry. Length: 60-90cm (24-36in). Bites are rarely fatal.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img239_005.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Cottonmouth

(Water moccasin) Agkistrodon piscivorous Thick brown or brownish-olive body, sometimes blotched, and a yellowish belly, also blotched. The inside
of the mouth is white. Aquatic, it is found in or by fresh water in the southern US. Length: 60-130cm (24-45in). Belligerent, do not annoy!
Victims have suffered tissue damage and amputations.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img239_006.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Cascabel

(Tropical rattlesnake) Crotalus durissus Large with diamond-shaped marks, two dark stripes on the neck and a rattle on the tail. Nocturnal and
found in drier areas from eastern South America to Mexico. Length: 1.5-2m (5-6&frac12;ft). Aggressive. One of the world's most dangerous!

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img239_007.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Common lancehead

Bothrops species Brownish with paler geometric markings. Length: 1.3-2m (4-6&frac12;ft). Its many relatives vary from grey to brown or reddish
with similar markings. Various species occur in South America north to Mexico. Some are arboreal. Have caused many deaths. Tend to loop their body
before striking.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img239_008.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Coral snake

Slender and strikingly coloured often with bands of black and red separated by bands of yellow or white. Found in forests and grasslands from the
southern US into South America. Similar species occur in Southeast Asia. Length: 45-90cm (18-35in). Small-mouthed, somewhat reluctant to bite, but
deadly.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img239_009.jpg" />
</figure>

#### SAFETY RULES

ALWAYS walk on clear paths.

ALWAYS look closely before parting bushes or picking fruit—some snakes are arboreal.

DON'T put hands or feet in places you can't see, use tools or sticks to turn over logs or stones.

#### BITTEN BY A SNAKE

In the case of snakebite, identify the snake if possible-but don't risk further injury. If the snake has been killed, take it with you so that
antivenin can be accurately matched. Get the victim to hospital immediately but avoid them having to walk or expend energy-which speeds the
circulation of the poison. Do not apply a tourniquet.

## **BITES & STINGS**

The amount of venom injected is usually tiny, but it contains concentrated doses of fast-acting poisons, similar to those in snake
venoms—nerve poisons, stupefying ingredients, a convulsant, enzymes and sometimes formic acid.

Stings can cause faintness, fever, degrees of paralysis, difficulty in breathing, vomiting and diarrhoea. These symptoms usually pass in 24 hours,
but an attack of urticaria may follow after a week. Occasionally, severe allergy can cause death.

#### Scorpion

Arachnidae There are many deadly species of scorpion in tropical and subtropical regions, often living in and around houses. Colouring varies from
yellow and yellow-green to brown or black, shading from dark body to lighter legs and tail. Almost all are nocturnal. Cornered or crushed
scorpions tend to sting repeatedly with the tail—but of the 1500 plus species, only about 50 are dangerous to man.

The most dangerously venomous species in the US is Centruroides exilicauda, which is pale brown with dark stripes and about 8cm (3in long). In
southern Europe/North Africa the most common dangerous species is Buthus occitanis. Usually about 10cm (4in) long, it inhabits dry areas. The
Brazilian Tityus serulatus and the Trinidadian Tityus trinitatis cause numerous deaths each year.

Scorpion venom is neurotoxic-death results from respiratory/cardiac failure. Seldom fatal in adults.

#### Ant

Formicidae Found worldwide and closely related to the wasp and bee. In most species the stinger is very small and the venom mild, but the
dangerous species possess a combination of potent venom, large stingers and numerous aggressive workers.

The harvester ant (A) Pogonomyrmex is an aggressive species found in the western US and South America. Will attack without provocation, inflicting
dozens of painful stings in seconds. Though very painful, the stings have little lasting effect except in cases of allergic reaction.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img240_002.jpg" /> giant
bulldog ant(B) Myrmecia gulosa of Australia is 2.5cm (1in) in length with large toothed jaws and a stinger. Can leap several inches and will
attack in vast numbers with little provocation.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img240_003.jpg" />
</figure>

Not all species have stingers. The blood-red field ant (C) Formica sanguinea, of Europe, North Africa and northern Asia, squirts a formic acid
solution and then bites.
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img240_004.jpg" />

#### Fire ant

Solenopsis saevissima Introduced into the US from South America, fire ants are now a major pest in southern states. Dark red in colour and about
2.5cm (1in) in length, they build nests up to 9Ocm (3ft) high. The stings are very painful and can cause severe allergic reaction.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img240_005.jpg" />
</figure>

#### BEE/WASP Hymenoptero

Many species are social insects that occur in colonies which can number hundreds of workers. They build nests in the ground, in trees, under the
eaves or in the walls of houses.

Honey bee (Hive bee) Apis mellifera A worldwide species, the most highly developed of any commonly-seen social insects.
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img240_006.jpg" />

A honey bee can sting only once and the barbed sting is left in the skin of the victim. The glands at the base of the sting continue to release
venom for several minutes, so it should be removed as quickly as possible without pinching the sac. Symptoms: mild pain and swelling. Severe
allergic reactions are rare but may result in rashes, respiratory difficulties or death.

#### Wasp

Vespula Common throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Often build nests in or near human habitation. They build football-shaped nests covered with a
rough paper made of chewed plant fragments. The chief danger is from swarms, especially when the queen migrates from the old nest to establish a
new colony. Painful sting, but usually little effect other than some swelling.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img240_007.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Hornet

Vespa A large member of the wasp family. It is best to stay away from any hornet seen, as the nests are often hidden in the ground or gaps between
buildings and the killing of a single worker could disturb the entire colony. They will chase over some distance, inflicting numerous stings.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img240_008.jpg" />
</figure>

#### SPIDERS Arachnidae

All spiders possess poison glands at the base of their mouthparts, though few can harm humans. Try to prevent spiders making their home in your
house by not letting junk build up in basements, attics, closets, outdoor sheds, and garages.

#### Tarantula

Theraphosidae Despite their menacing appearance, most species are harmless. However they possess special barbed hairs on the abdomen which are
released when the tarantula is cornered. These are not venomous but are capable of causing local skin rashes.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img241_001.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Funnel-web

Atrax robustus These small 5cm (2in) long sleek-black Australian spiders are dangerously venomous. Commonly found in the Sydney area, they spin a
web with a deep horizontal funnel. Their fangs can penetrate clothing and the venom injected is powerful enough to kill an adult in 90 minutes.
There is an antivenin. Seek urgent medical attention.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img241_002.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Black widow

(Hourglass spider) Latrodectus species Found in North and Central America, and the Caribbean. Most species are 1-2cm (&frac12;-&frac34;in) long
with a round abdomen and a red/orange hourglass marking on the abdomen. They build webs in dark secluded places (garages, outbuildings, cellars,
attics). Also found in piles of clothing or paper and under lavatory seats.

The venom glands are under voluntary control, so that it is possible for a black widow to bite without injecting any venom. Medical attention
should still be sought.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img241_003.jpg" />
</figure>

Symptoms: within an hour a dull pain begins to spread from the bite up the limbs and into the back, chest and abdomen. Nausea, cramps, vomiting
and increased perspiration may be experienced. FATAL in young children. Seek immediate medical attention. An antivenin is available.

#### Red-back

Latrodectus hasseltii An Australian relative of the black widow. Its web is a tangle of dry threads. Often found around buildings, especially
outdoor lavatories! Can be FATAL. Seek urgent medical attention. There is an effective antivenin.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img241_004.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Katipo

Latrodectus katipo The New Zealand member of the genus, found on beaches of North Island and the western coast of South Island. Lurks under
driftwood, stones or well-sheltered plants. Can be FATAL. Seek urgent medical attention.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img241_005.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Brown recluse

(Fiddleback) Loxosceles species Found in Asia, the US, South America and Europe. Species are all similar: various shades of brown and a faint
'violin mark' on the centre of the mid-section. Common house pests, they inhabit dry dark corners or closets, and often hide in piles of
clothes or paper. Most bites occur when people put on clothing or shoes the spiders have crawled into. ALWAYS shake out items of clothing before
putting them on.

The venom is necrotic, destroying muscles and fat. At the time of the bite there is a slight burning sensation. Over the next 8 hours the pain
increases, the wound turns red and blisters. Bites are slow to heal (usually about 2-3 weeks) and leave a scar-gangrene can set in if untreated,
leading to amputation. Serious complications occur in a small but significant percentage of cases, in which the kidneys are affected and death may
result. Seek URGENT medical attention. Usual treatment involves excision of the tissues at the site of the bite followed by skin grafts.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img241_006.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Centipede

Scolopendra species Found worldwide under stones, in piles of wood and damp places. Most species outside of the tropics are 2.5-7cm (1-2in) long.
The hook-like fangs are located under the head and are used to grasp prey and inject venom. Bites may puncture the skin and cause discomfort,
swelling and infections, but they are rarely fatal. DON'T swat a centipede with bare hands. If one gets on you, avoid being stung by brushing
off in the direction the animal is moving.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img241_007.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Spanish fly

Lytta vesicatoria Found in southern Europe. Not technically venomous, but possess a chemical called cantharidin which makes them dangerous to
handle. Produce intense skin irritation when crushed, causing painful blisters.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img241_008.jpg" />
</figure>

## **WATER CREATURES**

### RIVERS

#### Electric eel

Electrophorus eletricus Rounded, olive to black in colour with paler underbelly. Native to Orinoco and Amazon river systems of South America.
Often prefer shallow water, where there is more oxygen. Length: up to 2m (6 &frac12;ft). The shock from a large one can be 500 volts, enough to
knock you off your feet—lethal to a small child. Very dangerous if you are shocked while swimming.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img242_001.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Piranha

Serrasalmus species Found in the Orinoco, Amazon and Paraguay river systems of South America. They vary in size, some are very small, but all are
deep-bodied and thickset, having large jaws with razor-sharp interlocking teeth. Length: up to 50cm (20in). They attack in groups and can be very
dangerous, particularly in the dry season when the water level is low.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img242_002.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Candiru

Vandellia cirrhosa Not much thicker than a pencil lead, a scaleless, parasitic catfish of South America. Said to have an affinity for urine and to
seek to enter the urogenital openings of the body, their rear-pointing spines causing great pain. Length: 6.5cm (2&frac12;in). Wear tight
protective clothing over genitalia if tempted to bathe in suspect rivers and streams.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img242_003.jpg" />
</figure>

### SEAS/RIVERS

Stingray Dasyatidae A danger in shallow waters worldwide. There are marine and freshwater species, the latter occurring in tropical South America
and West Africa. Very variable, but all share flat shape and long narrow tail with one or more barbed venom-producing spines along its length.
Usually lie buried in mud/sand. When stepped on by an unwary wader they swing their muscled tails with enough force to drive the spine into the
foot or leg of the victim. The wound is very painful and slow to heal. If untreated, secondary infections can rapidly develop. Amputation or death
may result, seek urgent medical attention.

In waters where stingrays are known to be found, waders should shuffle their feet along the bottom to avoid stepping on them.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img242_004.jpg" />
</figure>

### SALT WATER

#### Tang

(Surgeonfish) Acanthuridae Found in tropical oceans where they often form large schools. Thin-bodied oval fish, often colourful. Small venom
glands in the dorsal spines, but the danger comes from the razor-sharp spines near the tail, which in some species open like a flick knife.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img242_005.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Weeverfish

Trachinidae Tapering, dull-coloured, they lie part buried in shallow sandy bays along the coasts of the North Sea, Mediterranean and the Atlantic
coast of Africa. Length: 30cm (12in). The most venomous fish in temperate and northern seas. Spines on the back and gills inject venom. Secondary
infections and gangrene may develop. Can be FATAL

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img242_006.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Toadfish

Batrachoididae Bottom-dwelling fish, found almost worldwide in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters—marine and freshwater. All species
look much alike-dull-coloured with large mouths. Length: 7-l0cm (2&frac34;-4in). Spines on either side of the head inject venom (though not all
varieties are poisonous). Stings are painful but not dangerous.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img242_007.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Zebrafish (Lionfish)

Pterois species Lives amongst reefs, rocks, or in sand, in tropical and sub-tropical seas, particularly the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
Spectacular, usually with bands of reddish brown and white, large filamented fins and long dorsal spines. Length: 10-20cm (4-8in). Contact with
the spines causes intense pain and swelling. Heart failure may result. Seek urgent medical attention.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img242_008.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Stonefish

Synanceiidae Found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters and the Red Sea-especially common along the northeast coast of Australia. Their drab colours,
lumpy shape and sedentary lifestyle make them difficult to see amongst the rocks and reefs they inhabit. Length: 40cm (16in). When stepped on, the
dorsal spines inject enough venom to cause agonizing pain, convulsions, unconsciousness and even paralysis of the limb. Recovery may take months.
Sometimes FATAL.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img242_009.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Portuguese man-of-war

Physalia species Not a jellyfish, but a colony of semi-independent cells. Mainly sub-tropical-commonest in waters of high salinity like those
around Australia and Florida-but the Gulf Stream may carry it to more temperate waters. The transparent float or umbrella is harmless—the
numerous tentacles with their stinging cells may stream out for 15m (49ft) beyond the 20cm (8in) float. The stings are intensely painful and may
cause breathing difficulties. Even 'dead' ones can still sting.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_001.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Sea wasp

(Box jellyfish) Chironex fleckeri A cube-shaped bell, 25cm (10in) across, with clusters of tentacles trailing from the corners. These may be up to
9m (30ft) long. Large swarms sometimes invade public beaches in Australia between October and March. Venom can be FATAL in large doses-can kill
within five minutes. Stings are intensely painful—there is a risk of victim losing consciousness and drowning. An antivenin is available.
Seek urgent medical attention.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_002.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Yellow-bellied sea snake

Pelamis platurus One of the most widely distributed of all sea snakes and one of the smallest: 72-88cm (28-35in). Highly-toxic venom causes
respiratory paralysis and muscular pain and weakness. Can be fatal.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_003.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Banded sea snake

Laticauda colubrina Range extends from Bay of Bengal, Japan, and around coasts of Australia and New Zealand. Grows to maximum length of 1.4m
(4&frac12;ft). Grey above with creamy underparts, a series of black bands around the body and a paddle-like tail. Partly terrestrial. The bite is
said to be painless, but venom is twice as toxic as cobra venom. Seek urgent medical attention.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_004.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Blue-ringed octopus

Hapalochlaena species Small, sometimes only fist-sized, with a maximum spread of 20cm (8in), found in shallow waters and pools off Australia. Will
bite if disturbed. Venom causes swelling, dizziness and respiratory paralysis.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_005.jpg" />
</figure>
Apply artificial respiration. Seek urgent medical attention.

#### Cone shell

Conidae Sub-tropical and tropical gastropod, found on beaches and in shallow waters, reefs and ponds. Varying patterns. Length: 2.5-10cm (1-4in).
Venom is injected through a flexible, harpoon-like barb which pokes through the narrow end of the shell. Can cause temporary paralysis and
breathing difficulties, and DEATH within six hours.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_006.jpg" />
</figure>

### SHARKS

Only a handful of shark attacks on people are recorded every year and few are fatal, but caution is advisable when in waters where sharks occur.
Of the many species, only a few of those that swim inshore have been known to attack humans.

Try not to attract the attention of a shark. Head for shore as quickly as possible. Blood, urine and dead fish are known to lure sharks, so avoid
carrying fish or urinating in the water. If you see a fin, don't take chances.

#### Bull shark

Carcharhinus leucas of the tropical west Atlantic is stout, grey above and white below. It likes shallow water and may swim some way up rivers.
Length: up to 4m (13ft). Aggressive and dangerous.
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_007.jpg" />

#### Nurse shark

Ginglymostoma species Includes the grey nurse of Australian waters. Heavily built, large-finned, greyish above, white below. Length: 3m (10ft).
Often found close to shore.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_008.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Tiger shark

Galeocerdo cuvieri Found in tropical and sub-tropical waters, white belly, back blotched or barred when young, more evenly grey when mature. The
head is wide with squared-off jaws and snout. Length: 3.5m (11&frac12;ft). Often found close to shore.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_009.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Sea urchin

Toxopneustes pileolus Most sea urchins have needle-sharp spines capable of piercing even gloves and flippers, foxopneustes is a venomous variety
found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters with three-valved spines, each with its own venom gland. Seek medical attention.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img243_010.jpg" />

## **VECTORS**

Vectors (hosts or carriers of disease) range from small insects to large mammals. Some play host to insect parasites such as fleas and mites,
which are the actual disease carriers. Rabies is carried by a number of mammals, though few invade urban areas. They include the domestic dog and
cat, wild dogs that scavenge around settlements, and stray and feral animals that roam urban areas. In countries where rabies has been excluded,
there is still a risk of other infections from a bite ([see also HEALTH: Pets and your health](/sas-urban/urban-health#pets-and-your-health)).

### Racoon

Procyon lotor Long brown fur with tints from grey to yellow, distinctive 'bandit' face mask. Found in the US, pacts of Central Europe and
Russia, it is well adapted to town and city life. A shy nocturnal creature, regarded as a pest because of its scavenging. An agile climber which
can hold small objects and even open windows. In some cities it has learned to nest in chimneys. It will bite only if cornered or molested, but it
can carry rabies. If bitten, seek urgent medical attention.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img244_001.jpg" />
</figure>

### Striped skunk

Mephitis species Sometimes found in city suburbs/towns in the US. It is infamous for its habit of spraying enemies with a strong-smelling
secretion from its anal glands—aimed with great accuracy, up to 4m (13ft). Look out for the warning signs: before spraying, a skunk will
stamp its forefeet, erect its tail, then do a 'handstand' with tail pointed over its head away from you. Don't wait for it to drop
back on all fours and spray—get as far away as you can! Skunks may bite if molested-seek urgent medical attention because of the risk of
rabies.

Control: Mothballs may deter them from making a home under buildings. To avoid long-term problems, make under-house spaces rodent-proof. Seek
expert pest control.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img244_002.jpg" />
</figure>

### Red fox

Vulpes vulpes Common inhabitant of cities and towns throughout Europe, Soviet Union, Asia, Australia and the US. Length: 60-90cm (24-35in). Wary
of humans, they will only bite if cornered or molested. Can carry rabies. If bitten, seek urgent medical attention.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img244_003.jpg" />
</figure>

### Coyote

(Prairie wolf) Conis Iotrons Smaller relative of the wolf, adapting to town and city life in the western US. Invaluable as a predator of rodents,
though attacks on children reported in Los Angeles. Length: 120cm (47in). Can carry rabies. Seek urgent medical attention if bitten.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img244_004.jpg" />
</figure>

### Vampire bat

Desmodus rotundus Found in arid and humid tropical and sub-tropical regions. Nocturnal, they suck the blood of sleeping victims. Attacks on humans
are rare, but do occur. Saliva contains an anaesthetic, so bite might not be felt while you are asleep, and an anti-coagulant so wound may bleed
profusely. Body length: 7.5-9cm (3-3 1/2in). Can carry rabies. Seek urgent medical attention if bitten.

If ANY bats invade a building, seek specialist advice. Many countries have laws concerning these endangered species.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img244_005.jpg" />
</figure>

### Chipmunk

Sciuridae A burrowing rodent of the US and Asia, with black-striped yellowish fur. Most commonly found in crawlspaces under houses and in gardens.
Length: 25cm (10in). It can carry plague and fevers. Its fleas will bite humans.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img244_006.jpg" />
</figure>

### Brown rat

(Common rat) Rattus norwegico
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img244_007.jpg" />

The black rat (ship's rat) R. rattus
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img244_008.jpg" />

And the smaller house mouse Mus domesticus (C), can all be a serious health hazard.
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img244_009.jpg" />

Their urine and faeces contaminate food. Their fleas can carry diseases including plague, typhus, hepatitis, salmonella, fevers and worm
infections. Their sharp teeth damage woodwork, plaster, metal pipework and electric cables—sometimes causing fires. Lengths: A 19-25cm
(7&frac12;-10in), B 14-20cm (5&frac12;-8in), C 6-8cm (2&frac12;-3in).

Control: Block all possible house entry points. DON'T leave food exposed. Indoor bait and traps may be successful for mice-set them where you
find droppings. For serious infestations, ALWAYS contact an expert pest controller. NEVER handle a dead rat or mouse—there is serious risk
of infection from fleas/lice.

### African blackfly

Simuliurn domnosun Found near running water in parts of Africa, Central and South America. Will crawl up trouser legs and shirtsleeves and burrow
through any possible opening in clothing in their search for blood. Bites produce bloody red spot that will itch for days. Vectors of microscopic
tissue worm which causes river blindness (onchocerciasis) which affects more than 20 million people. Length: up to 5mm (1/4 in). Control: use fine
mesh nets. Wear chemically-treated clothing. If bitten, seek urgent medical attention.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_001.jpg" />
</figure>

### Housefly

Musca domestica Danger comes from their feeding on faeces and human food—they digest by regurgitating a 'vomit drop' of previous
meals on food, a residue of which remains to contaminate the food. Known carrier of 40 serious diseases including anthrax, typhoid, cholera,
amoebic dysentery, intestinal worms. Length: up to 5mm (&frac14;in). Bluebottles (blowflies) pose similar risks. Control: Cover food and waste
containers. Use door and window screens.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_002.jpg" />
</figure>

### Horsefly

Tabanus species Large brownish or blackish with clear or smoky wings. Some 2500 species are to be found worldwide. The bites can penetrate leather
and are very painful. Can transmit anthrax, rabbit fever (tularaemia), worm diseases and forms of sleeping sickness. Length: 1-2.5cm (1/2-1in).
Control: Destroy breeding sites. Use door and window screens.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_003.jpg" />
</figure>

### Cockroach

Blattidae Nocturnal, redbrown, well adapted for running, with a flattened shape that allows them to penetrate cracks and crevices. These
scavengers are found worldwide in warm places—drains, sewers, kitchens. Their bodies and faeces can transmit a range of diseases including
salmonella, typhoid, dysentery, polio and worm infestations. Many asthma sufferers are allergic to dust from their discarded skins.

The American cockroach is 5cm (2in) long and prefers humid conditions;

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_004.jpg" />
</figure>

The smallest and palest household cockroach is the brown-banded cockroach which lays eggs on vertical surfaces such as curtains and gets into TVs
and computers, causing damage. Control: Poisons soon become ineffective as roaches build up a resistance. Traps can help. Seek specialist help for
serious infestations.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_005.jpg" />
</figure>

### Sandfly

Phlebotomus species Chiefly tropical—common in parts of Asia, Africa, Central and South America and Mediterranean areas. Bloodsucking adults
with long slender legs give a painful bite that can transmit sandfly fever, leishmaniasis—an often malignant disease with various forms
affecting about 12 million people. Control: Insecticide spray and repellent-treated screens. Seek local specialist advice.
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_006.jpg" />

### Mosquito

Anopheles species Of all insects, these two-winged flies of the tropics, sub-tropics and warm temperate regions, cause man the most illness,
economic loss and discomfort. Carriers of malaria, yellow fever and worm diseases such as elephantiasis. Control: Screens and fumigants. If
visiting a risk area, seek medical advice in advance.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_007.jpg" />

### Human flea

Pulex irritans One of 2000 different kinds of flea. When vibrations/ warmth signal approach of potential host, a flea can leap several times its
own length to feed. Most fleas are host specific, but will sample other hosts if the opportunity arises, making them dangerous vectors of some
diseases and parasites.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_008.jpg" />
</figure>

### Human lice

Pediculus humanus Sucking lice are living hypodermic syringes, transmitting diseases from infected hosts to healthy ones. A louse feeds almost
hourly, making a new puncture and causing a new itch each time.

Body lice usually live on underclothing.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_009.jpg" />
</figure>

Head lice cement their eggs ('nits') onto the host's hair. A single female may lay 300 eggs in a month. Control: Wash clothes
regularly. Use special shampoo. Check and recheck, treat again as necessary.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img245_010.jpg" />
</figure>

### Pubic lice

(Crabs) Phthirus pubis Usually live in public hair, in the armpits, sometimes in other body hair including the eyebrows. They are an irritant, but
not a vector.

<figure class="figure">

## **WOOD-BORING INSECTS**

### Woodworm

(Common furniture beetle) Anobium punctatum Common name for a small flying beetle or its larvae, which bore through wood. The exit holes are
1.5-2mm (1/16in) across, surrounded by small lemon-shaped pellets. Fresh clean holes and dust (in warmer weather) indicate current activity.
[See also SAFETY FIRST: Rot/infestation](/sas-urban/urban-safety-first#rot-infestation).

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img246_001.jpg" />
</figure>

### Deathwatch beetle

Xestobium rufovillosum Found in Europe and parts of the US. Larvae tunnel into dead or partly decayed wood, structural timbers and furniture. By
the time they are detected, by presence of 3mm (1/8in) exit holes with coarse rounded pellets or clicking sound adults make by banging their heads
against the wood, serious damage may already have been done. Not common.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img246_002.jpg" />
</figure>

### House longhorn

(Old house borer) Hylotrupes bajulus A very destructive beetle found worldwide in warm conditions, named after its two long antennae. The larvae
bore through seasoned softwoods. It is claimed that their activity is audible. Oval exit holes, 10x6mm (3/8x1/4in) are surrounded by a cluster of
fairly large, compact wood-dust pellets. Larval stage lasts 11 years, allowing time for considerable damage.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img246_003.jpg" />
</figure>

### Powder post beetle

(Auger beetle/ Shot hole borer) Lyctidae. Found worldwide, so called because of the dry, powdery dust extruded from burrows when adults emerge.
Exit holes circular, 1.5mm (1/16in). Tends to attack seasoned or dry timber. New timber may be affected.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img246_004.jpg" />

### Termite

Reticulitermes species Typical of the numerous species found worldwide in warmer regions. Some species cause widespread damage to homes,
outbuildings, fences and posts and are viewed as a serious problem in (at least) the US, Africa and Australia-although at least two species have
become established in parts of Europe, particularly around the Mediterranean.

Most species have the same or similar members-Reticulermes are typical with soft pale-bodied workers(A), which process the wood. Other members of
the colony usually only eat 'secondhand'.

The soldiers (B) may have very large jaws (some species have smaller jaws and a horn-like extension on top of the head) Either type is capable of
exuding a repellant, possibly caustic, secretion to deter attackers.

Winged adults (C) have darker bodies and swarm in great numbers in the mating season. They fly off to start new colonies (often only over a short
distance). When they land, their wings become detached but may be seen glistening on the ground.

Depending on species and the size of the colony, they may nest in dry, damp or rotten wood or build large galleries underground sometimes with
large 'ventilation' tubes above ground). Some, reliant on moisture and darkness, may construct easily-visible extension tubes as tunnels
to reach wood above ground without having to expose themselves to sunlight.

Termite infestation should be taken very seriously. Treatment should be done by specialists, and may involve spraying of timbers and soil, digging
in and destroying nests and replacing timbers.

### Carpenter ant

Camponotus species Large brown/black ants found in the US, continental Europe and Asia. Live in wood and chew out burrows. Easily mistaken for
termites. Reproductive winged members of the colony leave in a swarm to form new colonies. Piles of broken-off wings a clue to their
presence-other indications: slit-holes in wood with faeces resembling sawdust outside. They leave nests to scavenge for food. Partial to sugar.

### Carpenter bee

Xylocopa virginica A tunnelling bee, it resembles a very large bumblebee. It makes a single large hole, 2cm (&frac34;in) in diameter, turns
through 90&deg; and excavates extensive galleries (which run with the grain of the wood), in which to lay eggs. Length: 2.5cm (1in).

## **READING THE SIGNS**

We are surrounded by symbols which try to instruct us or alert us to danger. They are usually accompanied by an appropriate message or explanation
of a specific hazard.

In general, safety signs fall into four categories. A blue sign indicates that the message is mandatory and must be obeyed. Green symbols offer
instructional guidance on safety and safeness. A yellow and black triangle is an alert to danger—a warning of a slip hazard perhaps. A red
symbol with a diagonal line through it means 'Oh no you don't'!

Most of the following examples can vary in meaning—always read the accompanying message. Before you read the explanatory notes, see how many
you understand.

### WORK HAZARDS

Workers, visitors and even the general public may be at severe risk.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img247_001.jpg" />

1 An exclamation mark is a general hazard warning. Read the accompanying message.

2-9 All warnings that protective gear is required must be obeyed, or preferably exceeded. There may be a risk of permanent physical damage.

10 Wear a safety harness. This may apply on scaffolding, on a rig, on the framework of a tall unfinished building. Don't take chances!

11 Now wash your hands. Sometimes seen on the exit door from a lavatory—but may indicate that you should wash toxic/harmful substances from
your hands before going to the lavatory or eating.

12 Keep locked. May restrict access for security or safety reasons.

13 & 14 If your machine has a fixed or removable guard, use it!

15 Sound your horn. Forklift and other vehicle drivers should alert pedestrians and other drivers of their presence.

16 Stack correctly. Heavy boxes or crates may come crashing down on you. There may also be a danger of goods lower down in the 'pile'
being crushed.

### WORK GUIDANCE

You MUST know the dangers of your job-and how to deal quickly with accidents group of machines/a whole department/the whole workplace.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg alt="Work Guidance" src="/images/img248_001.jpg" />
</figure>

1 First-aid symbol. Should be clearly displayed.

2 This is drinking water. If cancelled by a diagonal stroke or a cross, the meaning is reversed—do NOT drink.

3 Emergency showers—or simply showers, if a full wash is required after working with hazardous materials.

4 Emergency eyebath/eye-washing station.

5 Emergency stop. Hit the button!

6 This is the main switch. It will deactivate the machine/a whole department/the whole workplace.

All green symbols offer information and/ or guidance and are there for your safety. They are often combined with directional arrows, telling you
how to reach a first-aid station or emergency showers for example. Fire exits and fire escape routes are usually shown in green.

### PHYSICAL RISKS

These symbols are aimed primarily at the workforce, but visitors and members of the public are also required to take note.

<figure class="figure">
<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img248_002.jpg" />
</figure>

1 Beware! Objects or heavy loads may come crashing down on you.

2 Trip hazard. This indicates that there is a change in ground level, an uneven surface or there is debris lying about.

3 Slip hazard. Ground or flooring may be greasy or wet. All people are at risk unless wearing non-slip footwear.

4 Overhead danger. There are sharp projections or obstacles which may cause severe injury.

5 Roof covering is unsafe-do NOT attempt to walk on it without crawlboards. Risks may be very severe.

6 Guard dogs on patrol. They don't ask questions!

7 Escalator signs to remind you to carry dogs (and small children!), not to stand with your foot near the edge of the step and to face the
direction of travel. Even if YOU feel safe on escalators, there is always the danger that someone behind or in front of you may fall and take you
with them.

### SUBSTANCE HAZARDS

Risks may be very serious indeed. Usually, accompanying warnings spell out the dangers and the emergency action required. These signs may indicate
that you should not even be in the vicinity of the substance, or may instruct you to wear proper protective gear.

1 There is a risk of electrocution-possibly involving very high voltages above normal domestic or three-phase power.

2 Voltages may be high enough to arc across a gap—even getting close could mean risking death.

3 There is a severe risk of fire-perhaps from a flammable substance or a heat-producing process.

4 Lasers in use. Degrees of danger usually indicated, from class 1 (low) to class 4 (high). The higher the class, the greater the risk to eyes,
skin and tissues.

5 Radioactive hazard. Risks may be slight (class 1) or severe (class 3). Read the warning which will indicate the type of radiation—gamma
rays or x-rays, perhaps, which are ionizing radiation.

6 Nonionizing radiation. Risks are law but exposure should be minimized.

7 & 8 Corrosive substance likely to burn skin and tissues. There may be other qualifying notices.

9 A skull and crossbones is another multipurpose sign, often indicating toxic dangers, as in 10.

10 A skull and crossbones is another multipurpose sign, often indicating toxic dangers.

11 One of the more recent signs—biohazard. These may be viral, fungal, bacteriological, disease or genetic hazards.

12 Biohazards are usually explained more fully.

13 Harmful substance. Keep away from foodstuffs.

14Usually accompanied by the words harmful or irritant. Common on domestic products.

15 & 16 Intended for the workplace, but serve as a reminder to all that when C02 or halon fire extinguishers have been discharged, the area
MUST be evacuated and ventilated.

17 - 20 These are the most common variations of hazchem (hazardous chemical) warning signs. The codes indicate the measures the fire brigade must
take to deal with a fire involving potentially dangerous substances (see [WORK & PLAY](/sas-urban/urban-work-and-play)). These symbols are commonly
seen on haulage vehicles.

### FIRE

1 A typical example of a fire drill notice-intended for the workplace, but could be adapted for the home.

2 Escape door or emergency exit this way. There may be colour-coded arrows to follow if the route is complicated.

3 The tick indicates an assembly or muster point, where a personnel check can be made to ensure that a building has been fully evacuated.

4,5 & 6 Self-explanatory because of the added wording. Now you know where the extinguisher and hose are, do you know how to use them?

7 Fire hazard.

8 Risk of explosion.

9 & 10 Obvious! No smoking. No naked flames. If you see these, DON'T ignore them.

11 If a fire breaks out here, DON'T use water or a water extinguisher.

12 Extinguishers are colour-coded—use the right type for each fire (see [FIRE!](/sas-urban/urban-fire)).

### GENERAL WARNING

13 Any message preceded by an exclamation mark means: Read this... you are at risk.

14 Standard symbols to indicate: Keep dry. Fragile (treat as glass). This way up. There are hundreds of variations on these worldwide.

15 Litter may be a nuisance, but it may also be a severe hazard or a fire risk.

16 Smile? You're on closed-circuit television (CCTV)!

17 NOT drinking water.

18 No pedestrians. Can also mean 'keep out', which might be for your safety.

19 No crash helmets? Take it off before entering a building/area, especially where money is handled—or you could be mistaken for an armed
robber.

20 No dogs.
