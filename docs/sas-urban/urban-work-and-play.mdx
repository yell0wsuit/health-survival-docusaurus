Many jobs involve hazardous processes or chemicals, but even working in an office may pose severe risks. Leisure activities, too, carry a level of
danger—this may be part of the thrill of many sports, but serious injuries are common.

## **The workplace**

Although factories, shops and business premises may be regulated by laws concerning work conditions and safety measures, it is the workforce
itself which must see that these laws are implemented. The people who actually do the jobs should be most able to see when laws are ignored, and
to recognize when safety measures are inadequate.

Discover, through your union or staff organization, what regulations apply and see that they are followed. An occupation should NOT involve you
risking your life or your long-term health ([see here](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#reading-the-signs)).

:::tip[PLEASE NOTE]

It is not possible to give full details of EVERY type of work hazard for EVERY occupation. The information given here is designed to highlight
types of hazard, some of which may be quite unusual. Think about YOUR job and its risks. Are you safe?

:::

#### Fire

The provision of appropriate smoke detectors, alarms, sprinkler systems, fire-fighting equipment, fire exits and escape routes is VITAL. Use
fire-fighting equipment only if you have been trained and you know what kind of fire it is appropriate for. Know the location of fire exits. Fire
drills should be held regularly and taken seriously. Responsibility for helping any disabled or injured colleagues, or anyone else who might need
special help, should be assigned and such assistance practised ([see FIRE!: Equipment &amp; drills](/sas-urban/urban-fire#equipment--drills)).

:::danger[Warning]

Don’t increase lire risks! NEVER let piles of inflammable waste or scrap build up in the workplace. ALWAYS clear up spills of oil, fuels
and solvents.

:::

### Hazardous chemicals

Where hazardous chemicals and other potentially dangerous materials are stored or are used ‘hazchem’ symbols should be displayed. These
indicate the nature of the danger to the emergency services and give them guidelines for dealing with it. Unfortunately the codes are not
internationally identical ([see here](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#reading-the-signs)).

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img158_002.jpg" />

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Even if you don’t know the meaning of the codes yourself, ALWAYS give them to the emergency services when alerting them to a fire or
accident. Doing so may save seconds-or lives!

:::

Most hazchem codes are made up of two or three characters. The first is usually a number which denotes the type of fire-fighting or controlling
agent to be used:

1 = Water

2 = Water fog

3 = Foam

4 = Dry agent

The first letter indicates the type of dangerous substance which is involved, what precautions must be taken and whether or not the toxicity of
the substance means that all spillages must be contained. Where dilute is indicated, the residue may be washed away to drains. The instruction to
contain implies that it is important to prevent chemicals reaching drains or watercourses.

Where E is shown, people should be evacuated from the building or the vicinity of the incident. There may be other better-known symbols or whole
words included-CYLINDERS indicates the risk of a serious explosion.

#### Care at work

Chemicals such as mercury compounds were once used in the millinery trade. These have been known for some time to damage the brain, to produce
‘mad hatters’. In many cases, such as this, the dangers were recognized too late.

The effects of chemicals are frequently cumulative—they build up in the blood and may cause disability or even cancer later in life. If
your work involves handling any potentially hazardous substances or inhaling fumes or airborne particles, you should ensure that proper provision
is made for your protection.

Protective clothing is only one element to consider. Methods which control and/or contain the hazard at source are the first requirement and
proper ventilation is essential ([see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS: Protective clothing](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards#protective-clothing)).

The storage and handling of flammable, explosive, caustic and toxic materials, especially liquids and gases, is another obvious area where strict
safety measures are required,

#### Graphic designers/illustrators

Spray glues are commonly used—although steps have been taken to discourage such substances. The main dangers are from the solvents employed
([see POISONS: Solvents](/sas-urban/urban-poison#solvents-in-the-home)). Although these aerosol glues allow for fast working methods, the
breathing of solvent vapours and glue particles has been proven to cause respiratory disorders. Other symptoms which may indicate inadequate
ventilation are: headaches, nausea, short-term memory loss and dermatitis. Long-term effects may be far more serious—involving heart and
liver damage and cancers.

Airbrushes-devices which atomize paints, inks and dyes—are also common. Many pigments are HIGHLY dangerous, especially when inhaled or
ingested ([see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS: Artists’ paints](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards#other-crafts)).

:::danger[Warning]

NEVER put paintbrushes in your mouth to ‘put a point on them’. Depending on the types of pigment involved, the cumulative effects
could be extremely harmful-even fatal. The most dangerous pigments include almost all metal/metal oxide colours and lamp black. Aniline dyes
are also poisonous.

:::

Adequate and specialized ventilation systems or special spray booths should be used for better spray glues and airbrushes. Comfortable breathing
protection would be sensible. The alternatives to spray glues include special adhesive waxes which are relatively safe for long-term use.

:::info[SOLVENT RISKS]

Many shoe repair and dry-cleaning shops may have insufficient ventilation. Shoe repairs commonly involve the use of powerful solvent-based
adhesives. Dermatitis is an extremely common side effect, also caused by the leather dyes and polishes, but there are far more serious risks
from constant inhalation of solvent vapours. Dry-cleaning solvents are equally toxic. Short-term effects may include headaches, nausea and
memory loss. Long-term effects may involve heart and liver problems and cancers ([see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards) and
[POISONS](/sas-urban/urban-poison)).

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

You MUST understand the dangers of dealing with chemicals on a Long-term basis (see also SAFETY FIRST and
[DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards)):

- MAKE SURE you know what to do in the event of any accident with chemicals—spillages may combine together to produce toxic or
    dangerous effects
- NEVER transfer chemicals from original marked containers to improvised bottles and jars
- NEVER leave containers open
- MAKE SURE all containers are labelled correctly and clearly
- NEVER use chemicals from indistinctly-labelled containers
- BE TIDY? BE SAFE! Clear up spills as advised and dispose of as directed. Disposal information MUST be available to you

:::

### Diseases/disorders

For centuries, it has been known that workers in certain industries and occupations were prone to particular diseases and disorders. Coal miners
and quarrymen were often stricken by the lung diseases pneumoconiosis and silicosis.

There are many other trades in which the risk of illness, injury or early death was the price for being in work. Today, an increasing number of
hazards are now being recognized which were previously ignored or not understood.

:::danger

Additional information on safety in the work area and protective clothing can be found in [DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards).

:::

Dusts of many kinds, including metals, woods, minerals and even flour, may seriously damage health-affecting lungs, nose, throat, eyes, skin,
digestive and urinary systems, the brain and nervous systems (see, for instance,
[DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS: Wood dust](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards#angle-grinders)). Wear the correct level of breathing protection.

:::danger[Warning]

Mineral oils!: All kinds of mineral oil, from bitumen and petroleum to paraffin and lubricants, present health risks. Most common problems are
acne and dermatitis, but there are also risks of cancer and of respiratory problems from inhalation of fumes and particles. Cutting
oils-usually formed by mixing a lubricating oil with animal or vegetable fats and other additives, present a particular risk-especially when
unrefined. Some machine operators may be continually exposed to or splashed by such oils. A man straddling or rubbing against a machine may
become oil-soaked. The scrotum is particularly susceptible to contamination and there is a great possibility of cancer. Women can also develop
genital cancer from contact with mineral oils. NEVER keep oily rags in a trouser pocket. ALWAYS wash your hands free of oil BEFORE going to
the lavatory.

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

The warning above is just one example of a serious work hazard—do you know all the risks associated with your occupation?

:::

#### It’s up to you

Take a look at your colleagues at work—especially older ones who have been doing a job for many years. Do many of them show similar health
problems? Those who do may have been heavy smokers or have other similarities that make them more prone to diseases—but could their problems
be work related? Will the same things happen to you if you continue to work in the same way?

When people have ‘always done it this way and it’s never done me any harm’, they may be being blind to the obvious.

:::danger

Additional information on safety in the work area and protective clothing can be found in [DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards).

:::

If there is a chance your job puts you at risk, are there ways in which you could change working methods or conditions to make it safer? If you
feel the risk is unavoidable, is it really worth it? Would it be better to look for something safer? You may not have many choices of occupation
but, if people refuse to do unhealthy jobs, eventually the employers may be forced to make the jobs safer.

### Physical damage

Many jobs, especially those involving manual work, place physical stress on the body and can cause damage to it, quite apart from accidental
injuries. Those at risk range from construction workers to teachers, nurses to hairdressers, shop assistants to computer operators. Common causes
of injury are:

- Bad posture
- Physical strain
- Vibration
- Repetitive operations

:::danger[Warning]

You don’t have to go out to work to suffer from work-induced illnesses and disorders. Domestic chores can involve the same strains and
cause the same problems and stresses.

Home workers and freelances should he particularly aware of the dangers of their jobs and the stresses induced by poor work environments. They
may develop had work practices or take undue risks because they have no one else to alert them.

:::

#### Accidents

Many jobs involve working with dangerous tools, fast-moving machinery or in perilous locations. Where appropriate, helmets, goggles or face masks,
gloves and other protective clothing or safety harnesses should always be worn. Hair should NOT be worn loose and trailing parts of garments must
be covered, so that they cannot catch in machinery. Safety guards on tools and machinery must be used, even if it is possible to work more quickly
without them. A slight increase in productivity is not worth a damaged limb or a lost life.

:::danger[Warning]

NEVER operate a machine unless authorized and trained to do so. NEVER attempt to clean or clear a blockage on a machine which is in motion or
connected to a power source. SWITCH IT OFF AND DISCONNECT IT FROM THE POWER SOURCE.

NEVER wear loose clothing, long hair, dangling chains or other jewellery which could get caught up in moving parts. NEVER distract other
people who are operating machinery.

:::

Scaffolding and other high work sites must have barriers to prevent anyone accidentally stepping off.

:::info[SAFE MACHINE OPERATION]

When operating any machinery—industrial or otherwise—never start the machinery until you can answer ‘yes’ to All the
following questions:

- Do you know how to stop the machine?
- Are all fixed guards fitted properly and all mechanical guards in working order?
- Is the area round the machine clean, tidy and free from obstruction?
- Are you wearing appropriate protective clothing safety glasses shoes gloves etc?
    If you have ANY doubt about whether a machine is working properly, inform your supervisor immediately.

:::

#### Machine guards

Fixed guards prevent contact by any part of the body with dangerous parts of the machine. Interlocking guards ensure openings are automatically
closed before the machine can be operated and stay closed until the operation is ended.

Automatic guards may be operated by photoelectric cells, contact with a physical barrier or pressure-sensitive mats. These stop the machine or
prevent it starting if someone is too close to the machine.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Check that guards are in place and automatic devices are working properly BEFORE starting any machine. NEVER TAKE RISKS? By the time a machine
is stopped you may have lost a limb or your life.

:::

#### It’s up to you?

Sometimes an employer or manager may fail to implement proper safety measures, to save money or speed up output. The individual worker may make
the decision to work without protection—especially when safety equipment is cumbersome or uncomfortable. It is the responsibility of EVERY
individual to know and understand risks and to see that adequate provision is made to ensure work safety.

A study by the British government’s Health and Safety Executive showed that carelessness and human error were the cause of only a small
proportion of accidents at work—the main cause was the employer’s failure to provide a safe system of work. Make SURE that this is not
the case at your workplace.

#### Vibration

The long-term use of vibrating tools, such as pneumatic drills, hammers or chisels, chain saws and electric grinders, can cause hand/arm problems
leading to permanent damage.

Vibration damages the tendons, the nerves and the blood capillaries and may even lead to decalcification of the small bones in the hand. This
damage frequently shows itself as vibration white finger (VBI, also known as dead finger or Reynaud’s phenomenon)—an untreatable
condition which has been known as a risk to stone cutters, riveters and road workers for many years. Although there is no ‘cure’, the
conditions may improve if exposure to vibration is avoided.

The first noticeable symptom of white finger may be an intermittent tingling in the fingers. Next is intermittent numbness. Even when there is a
blanching of one or more fingertips (with or without tingling or numbness) this may not interfere with the use of the hand. The condition can
progress to affect more of the finger.

In cold winter weather, when the reduction of the blood supply is more noticeable, the condition is likely to be worse and the victim may find it
interferes with the use of the hands.

When blanching is extensive and begins to occur in warmer months, the condition is usually bad enough to affect all finger use. If you think you
have the early symptoms, see a doctor to be sure, and try to change the kind of work you do before the condition develops further.

#### Whole body vibration

This occurs when the whole body is shaken by a machine or vehicle. The effects vary according to the frequency and strength of the vibration and
the length of exposure to it. A frequency of less than once per second can induce motion sickness; from one to 80 vibrations per second can lead
to tiredness, disturbed sleep, blurred vision, piles, hernias and damage to internal organs. Bus and heavy goods vehicle drivers may be subjected
to constant engine juddering,

Suspended cabs in vehicles and improved mounting and maintenance of machinery can reduce the problem by eliminating vibration or helping to
isolate workers from it. If vibration does occur, the periods of exposure should be kept as short as possible to minimize the health risks.

## **Noise**

A great many jobs are noisy by necessity. Noise-induced hearing loss is among the most common work-related injuries and disorders. It is usually
due to temporary threshold shift (TTS)—the persistent noise level causes the hair cells of the inner ear to shift their field of sensitivity
upwards and they no longer respond to soft sounds.

Temporary hearing loss (‘auditory fatigue’) can occur after only a few minutes’ exposure to intense noise, but is usually reversible
after a period of time away from noise. When exposure occurs over months or years, only partial recovery may be possible. Deafness to certain
frequencies or even total hearing loss may be experienced. Where those exposed to noise are never away from work for more than two days, temporary
hearing loss is likely to become permanent hearing loss.

Workers in manufacturing industries exposed to high levels of machine sound are the most likely to develop noise-induced hearing loss. The
woodworking industry creates some of the highest noise levels :

- 100dB (bandsaws/panel planers)
- 105dB (edge banders/multi-cutter moulding machines)
- 107dB (bench saws/high-speed routers)
    Road and rail workers, airport ground staff and nightclub workers are among many others exposed to high noise levels.

If noise cannot be eliminated or reduced by redesigning the process or the machinery, some alleviation can be obtained by enclosing the machinery
or blocking the noise transmission path, using acoustic chambers, hoods or guards.

Enclosing workers employed in quieter areas is a parallel measure if they are not working on or do not have to be in direct contact with the
noise-producing machine. The risk can be further reduced by reducing shift times in the noisy areas.

#### Individual hearing protection

Ear muffs, plugs or canal caps on a headband can all be used to block sound from reaching the ears—but they do not remove the hazard.
Personal hearing protection must be worn BEFORE entering the work area or switching on noise-producing machinery. It must not be removed while
still exposed to high noise levels—not even for a couple of minutes. In a jet engine room, for instance, where noise levels reach 117dB,
removing ear protection for as little as one minute would give a ‘dose’ equivalent to the recommended maximum of 90dB for eight hours.

CHECK: Hearing protection should be compatible with other safety equipment—especially when worn with helmets ([see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards)).

:::danger[Warning]

Wearing ear protectors makes verbal communication difficult (unless radio headphone systems are used) and also muffles any warning alarms or
disguises the source of sounds, which could lead to accidents.

:::

:::info[PROTECT YOUR SIGHT]

Does your work put you at risk from any of the following?

- Flying particles of any material
- Splashing of liquids
- Dust
- Irritation by fumes or vapours
- Molten metal splash
- Exposure to infra-red or ultra-violet light, lasers or strong visible light YOUR SIGHT MUST BE PROTECTED. Whether plain or filtering
    goggles, head covers or separate fixed or movable shields are suitable depends upon the process ([see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS: Protecting eyes](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards#protecting-eyes)).

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

It is not only the operative who is at risk. Bystanders where oxyacetylene burners and similar tools are in use are particularly liable to
‘arc eye’, acute eye inflammation (and possible permanent damage) caused by exposure to ultra-violet light ([see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS: Welding](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards#welding)).

:::

:::danger

:::

### Radiation risks

Everyone must now be aware of the need for protection from radioactivity, whether in the nuclear industry, medicine or the laboratory. Any form of
radiation can be harmful above certain levels and radiographers, dental nurses and others who operate x-ray machines must ALWAYS be screened.

Light is a form of radiation and, although visible levels of light are not usually harmful, exposure to ultra-violet light, emitted by many
photocopiers, can damage the eye. The lid on the machine should cut out most of this radiation, but some blue light often gets through and can
damage the retina of the receptor cells at the back of the eye.

Fluorescent lighting also emits ultra-violet light, but at lower levels. Many people find that working under fluorescent lighting causes sore
eyes, headaches—even nausea.

Lasers can cause retinal damage—NEVER stare at them.

Workers in jobs where they routinely look at very hot surfaces, such as molten metal and glass, may run the risk of developing opacities in the
lens of the eye. Filtered goggles should be worn. Radiant heat can also cause overheating of the body and heatstroke.

:::danger[Warning]

Photocopiers: In addition to ultra-violet radiation photocopiers produce both hydrocarbon and ozone emissions. Nitrous oxide is also sometimes
produced and toner dust is suspected of being carcinogenic. Liquid toners can also give off fumes which can produce dizziness and nausea if
inhaled. Site copiers where ventilation is good. Limit time spent near a copier. Do NOT make copies with the machine uncovered, no matter how
laborious or time-consuming the job.

:::

#### Vdus

Visual Display Units—the screens of computers—are like televisions ([see Leisure](#leisure)). They emit some radiation,
but are usually manufactured to higher standards than televisions. Working at a VDU does demand that the operator sits at much closer proximity
than the viewer of a television would choose for comfort or safety.

Japanese studies (unconfirmed) suggest exposure to radiation from VDUs could influence miscarriages or deformity of the foetus during pregnancy.
It has also been suggested that sperm may be affected.

Measurable levels of very and extra-low frequency radiation do occur, though there is no firm evidence that these have any biological effect on
humans. These emissions do not come from the screen, but from the transformer windings and would be present in many kinds of domestic apparatus.

It has also been suggested that using a VDU damages the eyesight. It seems probable that eye problems among VDU users have been revealed by the
use of the screen rather than caused by the VDUs themselves, but any prolonged and concentrated viewing can cause eyestrain.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Anyone with uncorrected, or imperfectly-corrected eye defects is likely to suffer greater eyestrain when using VDUs than those with
properly-corrected vision. A thorough eye test by an ophthalmologist is recommended before anyone begins work with VDUs, and annually
thereafter. Restrict working time to about an hour, before taking a break for a few minutes to rest the eyes.

:::

The flickering of the screen, though usually imperceptible, may be a risk to people already subject to forms of epilepsy affected by flickering
light or striped patterns.

The build-up of an electrical charge on the screen may be linked to forms of dermatitis on the face and hands of some computer operators with
particularly sensitive skin.

Most VDU problems are caused by bad work postures, poor lighting conditions or concentrated work for long periods without break or exercise.

:::info[RADIOGRAPHERS]

Radiographers, dental nurses and others who operate x-ray equipment are continually at risk from radiation, if they do not take proper
precautions. Always retreat behind the appropriate shields before operating the x-ray (and make sure that the subject is also protected,
except for the area which is being investigated). There may still be some slight risk from cumulative exposure, leading to cancer, though this
may not become apparent until ten or more years after you have given up the job.

:::

### Work posture

Badly-designed seats, having to stand for long periods, poor lighting that forces people to get too close to their work, uncomfortable bench or
desk heights and reaching too far, are all causes of bad work posture. They place parts of the body under undue strain.

Back problems and knee strain occur from lifting heavy weights, whether office furniture, sacks of cement or hospital patients. Sitting all day in
a bad posture will also cause back problems, whether driving a bus or working at a desk. Piles and varicose veins can be caused/aggravated by the
same conditions, and also by standing all day.

A brisk walk, or lying with the legs raised, will help to counter a build-up of circulatory back pressure and improve the flow of blood to the
heart. During a break, ‘put your feet up’!

#### Optimum bench/desk heights

- Work surfaces should be at a level which allows the arms to be bent at the elbow at right angles to the body.
- It should be possible to reach work by extending the arms while still keeping the back straight.
- Computer and typewriter keyboards should be at a level which allows the forearms to be at right angles to the body or slightly lower so that
    the wrists are not bent upwards. This is lower than a convenient writing height.
- When sitting, thighs should be parallel to the ground, with the legs bent at a right angle at the knee. Feet should touch the floor or a
    footrest used to prevent pressure on the back of the thighs.

1. Q. Can you avoid lights or images reflected in the screen?  
   A. Screens should NOT face windows. If direct or reflected glare cannot be avoided, it must be shaded and direct sunlight into the room should be
   diffused. Anti-glare screen filters also help to cut down on reflections.

2. Q. Is normal office lighting suitable for working at computer stations?  
   A. No. Ideal room illumination for operating a VDU is 300 lux, for general officework 500 lux or above. If you do other work at your computer
   station you should have separate desk illumination.

3. Q. Should you be able to read the screen without leaning forward?  
   A. You should be able to read the screen by looking down slightly, without bending your neck.

4. Q. How long should you work at your computer?  
   A. You should take frequent pauses, long enough for eyes to recover from the effort of reading the screen and to interrupt the repetitive strain of
   keyboarding. Breaks should be at least 15 minutes per hour of intensive work or every two hours of less intensive work. Mixing VDU work with other
   activities is the most efficient way of providing these breaks.

#### On your feet all day?

There are many jobs which involve standing for long periods which can lead to circulatory problems producing varicose veins and aggravating
conditions such as haemorrhoids (piles). Resting when possible, preferably with the feet raised, and taking a brisk walk whenever there is an
opportunity will help minimize these effects. Other aspects of the job will cause further problems. These are just some examples:

Hairdressers Staying at your work station while an assistant runs your errands is not a good idea. By all means let your assistant wash a
client’s hair, but collect the client from reception yourself and take the need to fetch towels or equipment as an opportunity for exercise.
Assistants shouldn’t be reluctant to fetch a client’s coffee—it all helps to counter the static nature of your job!

Nurses Are subject to many of the problems which doctors have to face. They frequently have to lift heavy patients in awkward positions, placing
great strain on the back. Follow all the advice given in training to make lifting easier and get help with heavy patients. Back strain is a major
cause of nurses being off duty and of them leaving the profession. Undue strain not only damages you—it puts patients at risk as well!

Aircraft cabin crew Stewards and air hostesses are not only on their feet, they have to ferry trays and push trolleys, often when the plane is
flying at an angle. However, their constant activity tends to counter some of the effects of standing. Long-haul routes, with consequent ’jet
lag’ problems, not only affect sleep patterns but interfere with menstrual cycles. Dehydration caused by flight conditions dries skin and hair
and can also cause or aggravate sinus and other conditions. Drinking plenty of water during the flight is even more important for cabin crew than
for their passengers!

Shop assistants If stuck behind a counter, make sure you have a chair or stool to relieve pressure on your legs, ankles and feet. If selling on an
open floor take the opportunity to move around—not just to greet customers and make a sale but also for the sake of preserving your own
health.

Petrol station and car park staff Forecourt attendants do a lot of standing, but they and people who work in car parks are also continually
exposed to petroleum fumes, contact with oils and exhaust fumes. Ensure that enclosed spaces are well ventilated and position yourself where you
can get as much fresh air as possible, when not attending to clients—this may be difficult at roadside stations as passing traffic provides
even more dust and pollution.

### Repetitive strains

These are exactly what the name suggests, injuries caused by repeatedly making the same demand on tendons, muscles and joints—such as using
a hand screwdriver all day or pounding on a keyboard. They include a number of conditions, from ganglions (small round swellings which are usually
painless) to inflammation of tissue, of tendons and of tendon sheaths, and can lead to osteoarthritis.

Repetitive strain injuries have been around for a long time, especially in jobs which require the same small movements to be carried out at speed
as, for example, in a production line. However, the victims, usually unorganized labour (so that no action was taken to change the system) often
gave up their jobs and were replaced by others.

It was not until the introduction of word processors and computer keyboarding and the appearance of repetitive strain injuries in white-collar
workers (especially journalists and others motivated to draw attention to the problem) that it was widely accepted—although there are still
some people who deny that the condition exists!

Proper ergonomic working conditions in offices which prevent undue pressure on wrists, elbows and fingers make it less likely that the condition
will develop, but the length of time spent at a keyboard should be limited and broken up by periods doing other types of work.

The problem does not usually occur with old-fashioned manual typewriters, partly because the physical actions are more demanding so that muscles
are more generally used. Speeds are usually slower and typists stop to change paper, to make corrections and to carry out other office activities.

### The unhealthy office

Offices might be expected to be much safer than industrial premises—no dangerous machinery, risky processes or toxic chemicals, no working
at heights or in difficult conditions. In fact, all these hazards CAN be present in the office environment—from guillotines to ozone
emissions, and from cramped conditions to electrical dangers.

Inadequate ventilation, poor lighting and high noise levels are common in many offices. All add to stress levels and undermine both health and
work efficiency.

#### ’Sick’ buildings

The workforce in, or users of, some buildings sometimes report a higher incidence of illnesses than other similar places of work—for no
identifiable reason. Offices, hotels and shops are among the types of building usually affected. Common symptoms which occur are:

- Irritation of the eyes, nose and throat.
- A feeling of dryness of the skin and mucous membranes.
- Skin rashes and itching.
- Mental fatigue.
- Headaches, nausea and dizziness.
- Recurrent coughs, colds and throat infections, hoarseness and wheezing.
- Recurrent gastrointestinal upsets.
    There may be no obvious cause for some of these disorders, but there may be common features in these buildings, such as:

- Forced and closed ventilation system with air-conditioning.
- Windows cannot be opened.
- Lighting is ill-considered, or unsympathetic.
- Whole interior relatively warm, with no temperature variation from one area to another.
- Indoor surfaces often covered with textiles—carpets or fabric-covered walls and room dividers.
- Poor standard of hygiene with drinks machines or staff ‘kitchens’.

It has been suggested that the causes of ill-health may include chemical pollutants, from carpets, paints, furniture, office equipment and
chemicals used with it—all of which can collect if ventilation is poor. Dust and fibres from furnishings and carpets, and bacterial
contaminants, are also possible airborne causes. Low humidity, inadequate air movement, the lack of negatively-charged ions in the air,
overheating, poor lighting and other undesirable environmental factors could all be contributory factors.

Apart from complete replanning of the interior of the building and its maintenance systems, there may be little that can be done to put things
right—precise causes are often almost impossible to identify. Individuals can improve their own circumstances by managing to get a window
open or at worst using a portable fan to combat stuffiness and high temperatures. The most effective action if you feel at risk is to change your
job!

:::info[LEGIONNAIRE’S DISEASE]

This is a serious illness, caused by a bacterium which is often present in both natural water sources and in domestic/industrial water
systems. Like humidifier fever, Legionnaire’s disease is usually caught by breathing infected water droplets. Symptoms include a high
fever with chills, headache or muscle pain-followed by a dry cough and pneumonia. Smokers, alcoholics and people suffering from cancer,
chronic respiratory problems, kidney disease and diabetes appear to be more at risk, as are people over 40—men more than women. The
vulnerability of those who are already ill possibly accounts for the number of outbreaks in hospitals.

Cooling towers, air-conditioning plants, industrial sprays, showers-even indoor ornamental pools and fountains—are the usual sources of
infection. To reach dangerous levels, the bacteria need special conditions, including: sludge, rust, scale, algae or organic matter in the
water and a temperature in the range 20&deg;-45&deg;C (68&deg;-113&deg;F).

Risk of an outbreak can be reduced by keeping tanks well covered to keep out dirt, designing water systems so that water does not stand
undisturbed for long periods, avoiding fittings that support the growth of bacteria and keeping hot water temperatures at 60&deg;C (140&deg;F)
in the tank and circulating at 50&deg;C (122&deg;F).

:::

:::info[IN THE CASE OF AN OUTBREAK]

- Call in specialists to identify the source of infection
- Identify and contact everybody who is likely to be affected. If they develop the disease they need care and treatment. It can be fatal?
- Treat contaminated water as quickly as possible

:::

#### Humidifier fever

Sometimes part of the ’sick building’ syndrome, but a problem which can occur in otherwise satisfactory buildings, humidifier fever is a
flu-like illness. It is caused by the inhalation of fine droplets of contaminated water from the reservoirs or holding tanks of humidifier
systems. As well as being used in air-conditioning systems, humidifiers are used by some printing firms to stabilize paper size and condition.

Symptoms of humidifier fever vary from a mild disorder with headaches and muscle aches to an acute fever and cough with chest tightness and
breathlessness on exertion. Symptoms usually appear four hours or more after the beginning of a shift at work and most frequently on the day of
return to work after the weekend or a longer break. The body usually manages to overcome the symptoms after 12-16 hours, but the problem is that
they recur on the return to work.

If humidifier fever is suspected, blood tests and samples from the sludge in the system can give confirmation. Preventing a recurrence, even with
regular cleaning and servicing of the system, often proves difficult and it is best to replace it with one which does not produce water droplets.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

AVOID humidifier fever by using:

- Steam humidifiers, which produce no droplets. Their high temperatures also kill micro-organisms
- Compressed air atomizers, which do not use water reservoirs
- Humidifiers which use evaporation instead of spray (though these can also develop contamination in their reservoirs)

### The public

Police officers, psychiatric nurses and social workers know that they may often have to deal with violent and difficult clients or members of the
public and, like people in the armed services, must accept some physical risk as part of their job. They are usually given training to help them
deal with people, but there are many other jobs that involve direct contact with members of the public that pose similar risks.

Bus and taxi drivers are now frequently protected by screens to prevent direct assault, but are still vulnerable when not behind that protection.
The same often applies to staff in banks, booking halls and enquiry offices when interview or information desks are situated in the open without
protection.

In many situations involving the public, feelings can run high and may lead to verbal abuse and actual physical violence—often as a release
for pent-up frustration or through fear or embarrassment. Disputes, whether over tickets for a concert, in a restaurant or in a store, can result
in similar physical assault. In such circumstances there may be some build-up to the situation and, if so, call for help or take some kind of
defensive action ([see SELF-DEFENCE](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense)) .

An exposed location makes you vulnerable to psychopaths or troublemakers, who may have no particular argument with you other than a focus for
their anger.

To minimize the risk, such attack locations should be contained in some way. Preferably there should be a wall to prevent approach from the rear.
If this is not possible, a fixed screen should be erected. The site should be as close as possible to a door leading to a non-public area which
can be easily secured against entry.

A help button should be placed below the desk so that assistance can be called if a situation seems likely to escalate or a sudden attack is made.
A telephone should always be available, for direct contact with security staff or the police without having to go through a switchboard. Desks
should be deeper than arm’s length, so that a blow cannot be directly delivered across them.

Anyone working in such circumstances must develop considerable tact in dealing with the public and keep calm in the face of provocation. Never
return violence, though you should seek to contain it. Members of the public may come to your assistance if you are attacked but, before
requesting such help, consider how much support might be given to your antagonist! You might provoke a riot!

#### Doctors

Doctors are exposed to the many diseases of their patients. Although doctors seem to develop considerable immunity, they are particularly at risk
from the viruses that produce flu-like illnesses. However, it is stress which takes the largest toll. Not only do doctors have to cope with the
strain of being responsible for their patients—often in life-and-death situations—but also with their social and emotional problems.

Many family doctors, interns or hospital housemen and women work excessively long shifts and are on call at unsocial hours. This can disrupt their
own personal and social lives and increases the stress load. Nicotine, alcohol and drug abuse, despite their professional knowledge of the damage
these can do, are sometimes a resort as a relief from tension, which can lead to or aggravate depression.

Doctors need to give particular attention to their own stress management and to take their own health seriously—all too often it is badly
neglected.

#### Banks/finance houses

The competitive work of dealing-room staff on the money and commodity markets places them under continual high levels of stress. Coupled with high
earnings, this may lead them to live the ‘high life’ in their free time. When recession hits or markets collapse their jobs can collapse
too.

It’s not only the wheeler-dealers who come under pressure. The most staid bank manager is dealing with clients’ problems—not just
handling loans and financial advice—and can be perceived as being the cause of them at times of foreclosure. This can lead to all kinds of
psychosomatic problems, ranging from backache to loss of libido. The traditional round of golf can be the cure-all if it is simply used for
relaxation and exercise—but not if the golf club becomes yet another place for client contact or competition. Wherever you relax or
exercise, be discreet about your job.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Handling cash: Shopkeepers, bank staff and anyone responsible for handling cash or paying in takings to the bank are all vulnerable to holdup
or assault, adding to the stress level of their jobs. Strict security procedures should be followed. Never take risks. Companies and
businesses should always have insurance cover and, if life or limb are threatened, heroism is NOT an option.

:::

### Working outside

Dress appropriately for the weather, making allowances for possible changes. Alternatively, take appropriate changes of clothes to your worksite.
It may be relatively easy to strip off if it gets warm, but having no extra protection against the cold and wet is inviting health risks if you
are exposed for long periods. Feet and hands are at risk from working continually in wet conditions. Fingers, toes, nose and chin are vulnerable
to frostbite when temperatures are very low.

Long-term exposure to heat and sunlight can have serious consequences. Apart from the very real dangers of dehydration, sunburn and
sunstroke/heatstroke are common. In severe cases these lead to death. The possibility of skin cancers should be considered.

Try to work in the shade and cover skin with light clothing. Sunblock creams can be used to protect the nose, ears and shoulders. The head and the
back of the neck should ALWAYS be covered. Other areas of skin should be protected by creams which reduce the harmful effects of the sun’s
rays. Make sure you have access to cooling drinks at all times.

Never underestimate the powerful effects of the sun on the naked eye. Eye damage can be permanent and disabling, and anyone working outside is at
risk. Sight should be considered a non-renewable resource—arm yourself with high-protection sunglasses which filter rays and reduce glare.

## **Leisure**

There are no areas in our lives where safety can be ignored. The activities we choose for relaxation often put us at risk in some way. Sometimes
the element of danger is part of the appeal of a particular pursuit, because it makes it more exciting. Some sports—jet-skiing or rock
climbing, for instance-are inherently dangerous. Many others—football, rugby, ice hockey—involve considerable rough and tumble that
can lead to injury ([see Sport](#sport)).

Do-it-yourself and crafts may carry a wide variety of health risks ([see DIY/CRAFT HAZARDS](/sas-urban/urban-diy-craft-hazards)).

### Television

Less obvious are the dangers from passive leisure activities such as watching television! Television plays a very important role in our lives,
gives a lot of pleasure and genuinely aids relaxation-but all colour televisions produce x-rays. Although shields within the appliance give
protection, people who watch for many hours sitting close to the screen could be doing themselves harm.

The level of risk to adults may be small but added to natural background radiation levels and the small amounts emitted by other household
equipment, it will be cumulative. Avoid too much exposure and reduce the risk of cancers by not sitting too close.

When playing video and computer games you are much closer to the screen than when watching television programmes. This increases the risk from
radiation and contributes to eyestrain, so take extra care.

:::danger[Warning]

Do not leave babies for long periods near a television that is switched on-not just in front of the screen, but at the side or behind the
appliance too. They could be affected by the radiation it produces.

:::

#### Out of condition

A greater risk for the ‘couch potato’ is the reduction of any kind of physical activity, which is encouraged by watching excessive amounts
of television.

It’s easy to get out of condition. If you haven’t played sport or taken exercise for some time, be wary of being talked into joining the
office sports team or taking the family on a hike. You may not be up to it-as many people discover when they try to run to catch a bus!

### Music

More quantifiable is hearing damage from the use of ‘personal stereos’ played at high volume. A Swedish study showed that people regularly
listen to pop music at a volume above 100dB—the European Community has a legal limit for workplaces of 90dB over a day and never higher than
96dB for more than two hours.

Wearing a personal stereo in the street, or while walking, cycling or driving could be very dangerous. Pedestrians and cyclists rely on their
hearing as well as their eyes to warn them of approaching vehicles and other hazards. Even while driving it is important to hear what is happening
around you so that you can be prepared to take appropriate action.

:::danger[Warning]

Don’t risk hearing loss. Turn the volume down before you switch your personal stereo on and then adjust to a comfortable level. Sudden
exposure to a blast of sound is particularly damaging.

:::

Sound levels at rock concerts are often well above the 100dB level, and in nightclubs may reach four times the European Community’s workplace
limit. Disc jockeys in nightclubs are particularly at risk. They should either work in a cubicle where the sound level is greatly reduced or wear
earphones to hear the music at a safer level.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Hearing loss usually begins with the higher notes—a buzzing or ringing sensation may develop and persist after the music has stopped. At
first the damage is usually temporary—but heed the warning and avoid further regular exposure to high noise levels.

:::

#### Electric/electronic musical instruments

Many electric/electronic musical instruments rely on full mains voltage—treat them with respect. Do NOT attempt rewiring or experiment with
combinations of instruments/amplifiers/accessories, unless you really understand what you are doing. Make sure that all plugs and leads are
capable of taking the loads imposed on them—physical and electrical ([see SAFETY FIRST: Electricity](/sas-urban/urban-safety-first#electricity)). BEWARE of playing in rain or wet locations. You could cause a short circuit, start a fire or-at worst-be electrocuted!

:::info[BARBECUES]

Brick-built barbecues, with steel cages for the coals, are safest—if you want to build your own. NEVER be tempted to use stone or
concrete slabs as a base for the coals—they could explode. Ready-made barbecues could be safer still—look for expected national
seals of approval.

- Watch out for partly-cooked meat—serious food poisoning may result
- Don’t barbecue meat or fish straight from the freezer. It may not be fully cooked inside when it looks burnt on the outside
- Partially cook food in a microwave before barbecuing
- Choose wood-handled tools, where possible, to avoid burning your hands
- Keep children/pets away from the cooking area
- Don’t site the barbecue under trees, near foliage, fences or sheds which might catch fire
- ALWAYS have a fire extinguisher or a fire bucket handy
- NEVER throw petrol or other flammable liquids onto a sluggish fire. Use small amounts of lighting fuel BEFORE lighting
- Store fuel and firelighters SAFELY-away from children

:::

### Spectators

There have been a number of recent cases of disasters in sports stadia. Check out exits and escape routes as you enter. Choose locations where you
could not be trapped in a crowd. Don’t let your involvement in the game blind you to the development of an ugly atmosphere among spectators or
the start of violent confrontations. Get out before you get involved
([see SELF-DEFENCE: Caught in a crowd](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#caught-in-a-crowd)).

#### Spectator injuries

Some grounds have netting between spectators and the pitch, but at many—especially amateur matches—there is always the chance of a
ball or puck being kicked or driven into the crowd. Be as alert as you want your home team to be!

At motorsports events avoid positions by the rails at dangerous corners. Such locations are not only more risky for the spectators, but increase
the dangers to drivers if they try to avoid crashing into the crowd. Crash barriers may be inadequate if there is a serious collision involving
flying debris, catapulted vehicles or fire.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Don’t create extra dangers yourself: Don’t smoke—and NEVER drop burning cigarettes. Don’t drop drinks cans or other objects
which could cause someone to trip or fall. NEVER throw any object—even at the referee! Cheer your own team, but DON’T abuse rival
supporters. Acting like a hooligan will not win you friends!

:::

### Angling

Angling means long hours spent sitting at the water side waiting for ‘a bite’. Makeshift stools or tree stumps don’t offer the body
much support. Provide yourself with a comfortable chair—it is as important as a comfortable sitting position at work. Make sure you get up
and walk around at frequent intervals.

Night anglers, especially, may be exposed to the cold and wet. Remember that temperatures drop at night, so take suitable clothing for the chilly
hours. If you do carry a drink laced with alcohol, you take the extra risk of lowering your blood temperature. You may also lose your judgement
and fall in, exposing yourself to the danger of hypothermia.

Avoid fishing on your own. Apart from the companionship and competition fishing with friends can provide, it also means that there is someone
there who can help in an emergency.

In an attempt to get good bait, some anglers use substances like carbon tetrachloride to subdue wasps and allow access to wasp larvae. Most
chemicals used for this purpose are highly toxic—even if exposure is short term.

The risks of water-related sports include the danger of drowning. Angling clubs should be committed to training their members in resuscitation
techniques.

:::danger[Warning]

Fishing near overhead power lines presents extra dangers-especially with carbon fibre rods. Don’t risk electrocution ([see SAFETY FIRST: Electricity](/sas-urban/urban-safety-first#electricity)).

:::

:::info[PLAYGROUNDS]

Although playgrounds are far safer for children than playing on the streets, or in derelict buildings or waste dumps, there are still many
hazards to be borne in mind. Playgrounds vary enormously—some have adult supervisors or are directly controlled within parks, others may
go for years without proper maintenance and may be unsafe. Most parents expect older children to have some ‘rough and tumble’ play,
but younger children may be at risk and should never be left to play unsupervised.

Apart from the dangers of vandals and bullies, who seem unable to leave the playground behind, look out for some of the following:

- Ground surfaces should be impact absorbing—a fall onto concrete or tarmac could be very serious. Fatal head injuries have been
    sustained by falling less than two feet. Even grass-covered soil is too hard.
- Litter—especially broken glass
- There should be a sign to tell you the rules of the playground (rules that no one ever reads) and who to go to for assistance. There
    should be a telephone close enough to be used for any emergencies. The sign should give details of the nearest hospital casualty unit.
- Swings, slides and climbing frames should be far enough apart for safety-also no piece of apparatus should be close to a wall or steps. If
    a child should fall from any piece of apparatus, what would they land on?
- Is all the apparatus regularly maintained?
- Swings for small children should have retaining bars to prevent them slipping off the seats. Slides and climbing frames should have good
    handrails and handholds.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Playgrounds are very often near or in areas where people walk their dogs. There are very real dangers to children from parasites carried in
dog mess. These parasites persist in the soil and are very common. Small children, with their lack of discernment, are particularly at risk
([see HEALTH: Zoonoses](/sas-urban/urban-health#zoonoses)).

:::

### Radio-controlled models

Almost any full-size vehicle can be reproduced in model form and operated by radio control. Modellers build boats, cars, aeroplanes and
helicopters which can take to the water, road or air like their full-size counterparts—with some of the same (and added) safety risks. Model
aeroplanes and boats in particular must be constructed with a great deal of care and often with the same structural integrity as the real thing. A
fault in design or construction can spell disaster. At the building stage, modellers must be careful with the hazardous materials they are using
like cellulose-based products and glues which give off dangerous fumes, and flammable/toxic epoxy resins and fibre glass ([see POISONS](/sas-urban/urban-poison)).

Model aeroplanes create special risks for operators. Propellers are the main cause of injury—the average speed of a model aeroplane
propeller is 17,000rpm—and the face, chest and hands are particularly vulnerable. Flying radio-controlled models requires a lot of skill and
dangerous crashes are most common among the inexperienced.

The best way to learn control skills is by joining a club. Membership is monitored so that users do not operate on the same frequency, which could
lead to loss of control. Clubs enforce other safety rules—for example, model aeroplanes should always fly beneath controlled airspace to
avoid the risk of interfering with REAL air-traffic control—all designed to make this popular hobby safer for everyone.

:::info[FIREWORKS]

The attitude to fireworks varies enormously from country to country. Most have legislation which prevents young children from buying
fireworks. Despite warnings, which are repeated again and again:

- NEVER return to fireworks which fail to light
- ALWAYS light fireworks at arm’s length, with a taper
- Move well back as soon as the firework has lit
- ALWAYS aim rockets and fireworks which shower sparks or shoot out missiles AWAY from spectators
- One person should be in charge of the fireworks during a display—or a well-organized team. Fireworks should be lit within a
    cordoned-off area. Children should be kept well away.
- NEVER hold fireworks—unless specifically stated on the label that you may do so. Even so, hold at arm’s length and point away
    from your face. Some ’safe’ fireworks can cause severe injuries
- ALWAYS lock pets indoors—some people and young children may also be frightened by the newer ‘improved’ bangs
- Keep unlit fireworks well covered—away from sparks and sources of heat

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

What goes up must come down. In most cases the remains of rockets and other airborne fireworks DO come back to earth again. Try to aim
fireworks away so that they will not rain down upon people, buildings, cars or anywhere where there is a fire risk.

:::

### On the town

When you go out for recreation you may be concerned mainly with avoiding any potential dangers on the streets—and probably give little
thought to the safety of restaurants and places of entertainment.

There are laws in most countries which cover hygiene in cafes and restaurants and fire regulations for places of entertainment, shops and
fairgrounds. Can you be sure that these regulations are being adhered to?

Checking restaurant hygiene is difficult. In some countries customers are welcome to walk into the kitchen, in others it might seem an unusual
request—but not an unreasonable one. Any reputable establishment should be proud to show clients where food is prepared.

While most establishments may be concerned to ensure your safety as well as your continued patronage, calls from inspectors are probably
infrequent and you will be dependent upon the vigilance and sense of responsibility of the staff. Attitudes to safety may sometimes be extremely
casual or members of the public may often be uncooperative—objecting to not being allowed to stand where they wish at a concert or in a
theatre, for example.

Be responsible yourself. Never obstruct an exit or exit route. If you see regulations being ignored—perhaps an emergency exit locked or
blocked—have a word with the manager in the interests of everyone’s safety.

#### Better safe than sorry

When you go to a restaurant, a theatre, a cinema or a nightclub, make sure you know where the exits are and work out the easiest routes to them.
It can save precious moments, if there should be the need to get out quickly. It only takes a moment as you go in and settle down—once you
get into the habit it will become automatic wherever you go. There have been very serious fires in many public places in recent
years—involving the loss of many lives.

If possible leave coats and bags in a cloakroom. Even in normal circumstances it is easy for people to stumble over them in the dark as they pass
along a row of seats or walk down an aisle. Even on a seat next to you, clothing and bags may be stolen—especially in the dark.

Don’t drop drink cans, ice cream cartons or chocolate boxes on the floor. If smoking is permitted, be VERY careful to stub out cigarettes
properly—in an ashtray, NOT on the floor.

## **Sport**

Awareness of the benefits of fitness has risen greatly over the past couple of decades and increasing numbers of us regularly play some form of
sport. A fit body can be your most valuable urban survival equipment. On the other hand, participating in sport with inadequate discipline or
training can easily lead to injury. A basic understanding of how your body works, together with an awareness of your limitations and a thorough
knowledge of your sport, will enable you to avoid all injuries but the purely accidental.

#### Why be fit?

A fit body feels good and lasts longer! Regular exercise increases suppleness, strength and stamina and keeps weight down. It helps control
hypertension (high blood pressure) and diminishes the risk of heart attacks, diabetes and strokes. When you’re fit, you are better able to
fight off the effects of poisons, or to defend yourself against physical attack. A fit person not only remains mobile longer—evidence
suggests that they live longer too.

Fitness is literally being in a suitable condition to perform a given task. Nowadays, it has come to mean an improved level of efficiency in the
muscles and cardiovascular system through physical exertion. Overall fitness can be broken down into three categories: strength, stamina and
suppleness. Different types of activity lead to improvement in each of these areas to varying degrees. Weightlifting, for instance, will not on
its own improve your aerobic capacity (stamina), or flexibility (suppleness)—as squash will—but will greatly increase your muscle bulk
(strength).

:::danger[Warning]

Do you suffer from any of the following conditions? If so, they put you in a high-risk group and you should seek medical advice before
embarking on ANY exercise programme.

1. High blood pressure

2. Heart trouble (angina, irregular pulse, previous heart attack, family history of heart disease etc)

3. Respiratory disorders (asthma, bronchitis etc)

4. Blood disorders (anaemia, haemophilia etc)

5. Muscle or bone disorders (arthritis, fibrositis etc)

6. Obesity

Additional risk groups include:

1. Anyone over 40 after a period of inactivity

2. Pregnant women

3. Women on the pill

4. Convalescents

5. Anyone taking certain drugs

IF IN ANY DOUBT CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

Specific kinds of fitness are needed for specific sports, and anyone taking up a new physical activity should be aware of the potential risks.
If you throw yourself too strenuously into a new activity without preparation, you are courting disaster. Take an initial fitness assessment
to pinpoint areas of weakness, especially if you are over 40. However unfit you may be, there will be a sport you can undertake safely.

:::

### Strength

All physical activity will increase your strength to some degree. Muscles convert energy into movement. They do this most efficiently when plenty
of oxygen is present, during aerobic exercise. If you continue to demand work from your muscles when there is no oxygen present, they are able to
produce energy anaerobically—but only for a short time.

Anaerobic exercise produces waste products, chiefly lactic acid, which leads to unpleasant ‘burning’, usually followed by stiffness and
cramps. In building strength, you must gently teach the muscles to work more efficiently without oxygen, and with fewer undesirable side effects.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

A well-built musculature protects vulnerable body parts. Strong abdominals (stomach muscles), for instance, help protect the lower back:
quadriceps (front of thigh) help support the weak hinge-type knee joint. Strong muscles mean you are less likely to suffer injury through
everyday tasks (gardening, lifting, housework etc.). Complementary cross-training can greatly improve your performance in your chosen sport.

:::

Training for strength involves short periods of intensive work interspersed with longer periods of gentle exercise or rest. There are NO short
cuts. Increasing your workload too fast only leads to lactic acid build-up, bunched, strained and torn muscles with undue stress laid on the
tendons which connect muscle to bone. ALWAYS warm up adequately before working out to enable your muscles to work efficiently and to reduce the
likelihood of injury. ALWAYS stretch after weight training to help disperse lactic acid and to lengthen bunched muscles which could limit
movement.

### Stamina

Stamina means endurance and relates to cardiovascular fitness. For maximum efficiency in converting energy into movement, you must be able to
deliver the oxygen in the red blood cells to your muscles quickly. Aerobic fitness is essential for many sports—squash, tennis, football,
rugby, for example.

At rest, an adult heart pumps five litres (about nine pints) of blood round the body. During exercise, the amount of blood pumped can increase to
as much as 40 litres (70 pints) per minute in a super-fit person. The heart of an unfit person will supply perhaps 25 litres (44 pints) per
minute, despite beating far faster! The more efficiently your heart works, the longer you can endure exercise, and the sooner you will recover
from it.

Aerobic exercise should keep your heart working at 70-80 per cent of its full capacity. If you build up a sweat and are breathing faster, yet
still able to hold a conversation, you are exercising at about the right level. Keep this up for 20 minutes, at least three times a week, and you
will improve your stamina gradually and safely. As you become fitter, you will need to increase the frequency and/or duration of the exercise in
order to maintain or carry on increasing stamina.

- ALWAYS stop exercising if you feel dizzy, nauseous, short of breath or tight in the chest. These are signs that you could be overtaxing your
    heart.
- NEVER stop abruptly after aerobic exercise. Walk around as you cool down.

:::tip[REMEMBER]

As your heart becomes more efficient, the risks of hypertension and coronary heart disease are reduced. More blood passing through organs such
as lungs, liver, kidneys and brain increases their efficiency too. Aerobic activity burns calories, converts fat to lean tissue and speeds up
the metabolism, helping you to control your weight. Improving your stamina makes you feel more energetic and more confident.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

TOO MUCH TOO SOON CAN LEAD T0 INJURY. If you are unused to exercise, begin SLOWLY. Try walking upstairs instead of using the lift. Get off the
bus one stop early and walk. Walk/jog to the newsagent, instead of having the paper delivered. Incorporate exercise into your daily routine,
and you will quickly start to feel the benefit.

:::

### Suppleness

However efficient the heart and lungs, however strong the muscles, the body is useless if it can’t move freely. Flexibility is the third
component of overall fitness, and is essential for good performance in most sports—you will also be less likely to suffer strains and
ruptures from the sudden reaches, kicks and jumps. Gymnastics, dance and martial arts demand and encourage great flexibility. Aerobics classes
should involve a stretching sequence.

To encourage suppleness and avoid bunched and torn muscles and strain on the heart, adequate warming up and cooling down periods are essential.
Each individual’s level of suppleness depends on the length and flexibility of muscles, ligaments and tendons. Women are naturally more supple
than men. You must always work within your limitations. Again, there are NO short cuts—the muscle will stretch when it’s ready. If you
try to force it, it will tear. Swimming is excellent for lengthening muscles.

:::info[THE WARM-UP]

Moderate exercise-jogging, walking, cycling, swimming-is a warm-up in itself. Most racquet sports and some team games include a
‘knockabout’ period, which warms the muscles and raises the pulse. IN ALL OTHER CASES, OMITTING THE WARM-UP IS THE EASIEST ROUTE TO
INJURY.

DON’T stretch a cold muscle. Begin the warm-up with a period of ‘cardiovascular’ exercise to get the blood flowing to the muscles
and to avoid sudden strain on the heart.

DON’T exercise after a meal. A large proportion of your blood will be circulating around the stomach and intestines during digestion, and
trying to divert it elsewhere can lead to stitches and cramps-potentially lethal in watersports. Allow 90 minutes for digestion.

DON’T ‘bounce’. Alternately stretching and contracting is more likely to tighten than lengthen the muscle, and it puts strain on
the tendons.

Ease into the stretch. Get into position, relax and breathe. Concentrate on the muscle groups which will do the most work—hamstrings and
quads for a footballer, for example. Be especially careful to warm up ANY muscle which is stiff, aching or has suffered a previous injury.

:::

Increase the time you spend warming up and cooling down and incorporate more gentle stretches to encourage longer, more flexible muscles.
‘Little and often’ is the key.

:::info[THE COOL-DOWN]

Prepare the body to return to its normal state. During exercise, your muscles help the heart by pumping blood to the lungs for re-oxygenation.
If you stop too suddenly, blood can pool in the muscles, starving other areas and making the heart pump faster to compensate. Dizziness,
trembling and even blackout can result if you come to an abrupt halt.

Cooling down and stretching are essential to disperse lactic acid and discourage the formation of inflexible scar tissue over tiny tears in
contracted muscles (which lead to stiffness). Slow down GRADUALLY and repeat the warm-up stretches after exercise.

:::

:::danger[Warning]

Pain in the chest or shooting down the arms can mean your heart is under too much strain. It doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re
having a heart attack, but you should still get yourself checked out medically just tor peace of mind.

:::

:::info[WOMEN AND SPORT]

Specific differences that may affect women’s performance in sport, or the risks of particular sports, include:

- Smaller hearts and lungs than men
- Less muscle bulk and strength than men
- Better fat-burning mechanism than men (useful in endurance sports)
- Higher fat percentage (25% on average)
- Lower centre of gravity than men
- Smaller stature (useful in some sports—riding, for example)
- Wide pelvis alters angle of femur—can lead to knee problems in running
- Breast pain and jogger’s nipple can be caused by running
- Joint looseness (useful in some sports—gymnastics, for example)
- Reproductive organs well protected
- Menstrual cycle can be affected by strenuous exercise
- Pregnancy hormones loosen ligaments
- The contraceptive pill increases risk of cardiovascular strain

:::

:::tip[REMEMBER]

‘NO PAIN, NO GAIN’ IS WAY OUT OF DATE. Yes, stretching and strenuous exercise can be uncomfortable, but there’s a difference
between a working burn and the pain of a torn muscle! Be sensitive to the difference! If the pain is sudden, unusual or excessive, slacken
off, STOP and find out what it is. The natural ‘high’—the endorphins and adrenalin stimulated by exercise, the increased blood
flow and oxygen levels—can blind you to your body’s distress signals. DO NOT use painkillers, strapping, sprays and creams to mask
injury. Pain is your body’s early warning system.

LISTEN TO IT!

:::

:::info[CHILDREN AND SPORT]

Medical advice and expert tuition should be sought to determine the effect of the stresses and strains of different sports on growing bones
and muscles. Exercise for young children should mainly involve learning balance, coordination and spatial awareness. As the young person
reaches puberty, hormone production and growth may be affected by strenuous exercise. NEVER force a child to over-use muscles and
joints—by lifting weights, for example. If a particular interest is shown in any type of sport, seek specialist advice to make it SAFE.

:::

### Types of injury

Some of the most common injuries associated with sports, together with basic preventative measures and first aid, are dealt with here. ALL coaches
should have training in the recognition and first-aid treatment of injuries associated with their sports. ALL sports centres, sports grounds and
gyms should encourage their members to learn the basics, too.

#### Muscles

Tears, strains, sprains and pulls of the elastic fibres that form muscle are very common. Many of these injuries can be prevented by keeping the
muscles in good condition, and by warming them up before exertion EVERY TIME. The quadriceps at the front of the thigh and hamstrings at the back
of the leg are particularly at risk from sudden movement, imbalance of power between the two sets of muscles and/or insufficient warm-up. More
serious is quads haematoma (bleeding within the muscle caused by a blow), most common in contact sports.

ACTION: Rest, ice, compress and elevate the affected part. This procedure is used for many sports injuries. The sooner it can be administered, the
more effective it is. Rest means REST! Stop playing, however much you want to go back on. ‘Ice’ can be anything cold to hand—a cold
drink can will do. Apply for about 15 minutes every two hours. Compress with a bandage, but NOT too tightly. Remove IMMEDIATELY if limb turns pale
or ‘blue’, or if pain is severe. Elevate the affected part to reduce swelling and throbbing pain. Use a high sling for arms. A normal dose
of aspirin can be taken as an immediate measure to reduce pain and inflammation. Seek medical attention—URGENTLY for haematoma, especially
if the area seems to be swelling.

:::danger[Warning]

Aspirin should NOT be given to children under 12. It can lead to bleeding of the stomach, and is potentially harmful. Do NOT use painkillers
to enable you to continue playing with an injury! Do NOT use painkillers on a regular basis.

:::

#### Tendons

Tendons bond muscles to bone. Since bone is rigid and muscle is flexible, it is the inelastic fibres of a tendon which often tear, swell and
become inflammed under stress. Tendinitis (inflammation of the tendon) is most common in the biceps, around the patella and the Achilles tendon.
These are often ‘over-use’ injuries, caused by repeated stress and can develop slowly. If you notice pain directly after exercise, coupled
with stubborn stiffness, or a burning sensation during exercise, you could be developing tendinitis.

ACTION: Rest and ice. Aspirin, if necessary. Seek medical attention.

:::danger[Warning]

Ironically, Achilles tendinitis con be caused by pressure from the high ‘Achilles protector’ on the buck of some training shoes. If
your shoes have these, CUT THEM OFF. Better still, choose training shoes without them.

:::

The most common tendon rupture is of the Achilles tendon. It feels like a kick from behind accompanied by severe pain at the lower end of the calf
muscle or in the tendon itself. You may be able to feel the gap where it is broken.

ACTION: Rest, ice and elevate. CALL AN AMBULANCE. Surgery is almost always needed at once.

#### Ligaments

These are tough bands of white, fibrous connective tissue that link two bones together at a joint. They are flexible, but not very elastic, so are
vulnerable to strain and rupture. The most common injuries occur in the ligaments of the knee, caused by sudden twisting or bending, and in the
cartilage ligament if it gets caught between the bones. Local pain, swelling and bruising are felt, accompanied by a popping sound if the ligament
is ruptured. Strengthen the quads to prevent these nasty injuries.

A sprained wrist occurs when the ligaments are stretched suddenly beyond normal range. It is less serious than a sprained ankle, which is one of
the commonest of all sports injuries. Ligament strain is a frequent cause of back pain, and is often due simply to bad posture. Keep your back
supple through swimming, aerobics or yoga and strengthen the abdominal muscles.

ACTION: Injuries to the knee ligaments can be serious. A rupture usually requires surgery. Rupture of the cross-shaped cruciate ligaments (inside
the knee joint) may not cause intense pain at first. You may hear a ‘pop’, and the knee swells within an hour. A well-padded splint can
help, but ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING. Seek urgent medical attention. For most ligament injuries, rest, ice, compress (lightly) and
elevate. Seek medical attention.

:::danger[Warning]

The hormones of pregnancy slacken the ligaments, making them more vulnerable to injury. Always take medical advice before embarking on a
course of exercise during pregnancy.

:::

#### Cartilage

This is a dense connective tissue at the joints of movable bones. The meniscus cartilage in the knee protects the joint surfaces, provides
stability and acts as a shock absorber. Twisting on a bent weight-bearing knee can tear and trap some of this cartilage in the joint-one of the
most common knee injuries. The knee might click/lock/give way and will swell within hours. Avoid twisting movements. Work on your quadriceps at
the front of the thigh to support the knee.

ACTION: Rest, ice, compress and elevate. Seek urgent medical attention. Partial or total removal of this cartilage is a common
operation—partial is preferable, since total removal increases pressure on the joint fivefold.

#### Bursae

A bursa is a small sac of fluid-filled fibrous tissue which helps reduce friction round joints and where ligaments and tendons pass over bones.
Bursitis (inflammation of the bursae) has many causes, most commonly pressure caused by ill-fitting shoes, over-repetition of movements etc. It is
characterized by tenderness and swelling and is rarely serious.

ACTION: Rest, ice, compress and elevate. Seek medical attention if there are signs of infection or if inflammation does not subside.

#### Bones

Fractures of the ribs, collarbone, radius (forearm), scaphoid (base of thumb), knee, shinbone, ankle and foot are occupational hazards if you play
contact sports, ski or ride. Pain is usually intense, immediate and pretty unmistakable-although ankle and radius fractures are commonly difficult
to distinguish from sprains.

ACTION: It’s better not to move the casualty if you suspect something is broken. Seek urgent medical attention.

#### Head/neck

:::danger[EMERGENCY!]

Any injury to the neck or blow to the head is potentially life-threatening. Loss of consciousness after a blow to the head should ALWAYS be
taken seriously. Seek urgent medical attention. If the victim is breathing normally, put them in the
[recovery position](/sas-urban/urban-health#recovery-position) ([see HEALTH: Save a life!](/sas-urban/urban-health#save-a-life)) to keep the
airway open. When the casualty regains consciousness, vomiting may occur, leading to [choking](/sas-urban/urban-health#choking-unconscious).
If the casualty is gurgling, gasping or breathing erratically, check that the airway is open and there are no obstructions.

IF YOU SUSPECT A NECK INJURY

DO NOT move the casualty. Gently hold the casualty’s head still and [MONITOR BREATHING](/sas-urban/urban-health#breathing) CLOSELY. CALL
AN AMBULANCE!

:::

#### Eye/nose/mouth

After any blow, scratch or cut in or around the eye, if vision is clouded or obscured or if the eye looks cloudy or bloody, seek urgent medical
attention. If it seems a curtain has been pulled across your eye, you may have suffered a detached retina, for which surgery is required. Apply an
ice pack to a black eye as soon as possible.

If you wear glasses or sunglasses for sports, make sure they have shatterproof polycarbonate lenses. If you wear contact lenses, remember that
they can be knocked into (or out of) the eye. Seek specialist advice.

Nosebleeds are caused by rupture of the blood vessels on the membrane inside the nose. Pinch nose, lean forward and apply ice pack. If bleeding
continues for more than a few minutes, seek medical attention.

Cut lips and tongue tend to bleed profusely, which can be quite frightening. Apply pressure and do not swallow blood as you might be sick. Seek
medical attention for large cuts, if bleeding doesn’t stop or if a tooth goes through the lip.

Broken teeth should be saved as they can often be replaced. AVOID swallowing or inhaling teeth. ALWAYS seek medical attention if you suspect
you’ve swallowed a tooth, or for someone who has been knocked out and lost a tooth. If you wear partial or complete dentures, it’s wise to
remove them before playing vigorous or contact sports.

### Clothing

Protective clothing is VITAL for safety in many sports. New, more comfortable and safer versions are always being developed—it’s worth
keeping YOUR equipment up to date.

#### Shields/pads

You wouldn’t think of playing cricket without shin pads, but many people balk at wearing them for football or field hockey. Since shin
injuries are so common, it’s worth overcoming the ‘image’ problem! Extensive body armour is worn for American football and ice hockey.
Boxers always wear gumshields, which can be custom-made. Men should always wear a box (genital protector) for vigorous or contact sports.

#### Gloves

Wear gloves to protect against blows (cricket, ice hockey), cold (skiing, motocross), friction burn (sailing) or to improve grip (riding, cycling,
golf, weightlifting etc).

#### Helmets/goggles

Injuries to the head and eyes are potentially EXTREMELY serious, even fatal. Headgear should always be properly fitted and up to date—spare
no expense. Cricket helmets with faceguards, similar to the baseball catcher’s mask, are increasingly worn, as are helmets for cycling. Do NOT
consider riding a horse without a proper helmet—the old-fashioned peaked hard hats need to be the specially-reinforced type.

Skiers should wear special filtered goggles to protect eyes against glare. Cyclists’ goggles will keep out grit and insects and prevent the
eyes watering. Swimmers need goggles to protect the delicate lining of the eye from chlorine and salts, while squash players should wear glassless
goggles to guard against the ball impacting into the eye socket.

:::danger[Warning]

ALWAYS buy a new helmet once yours has protected your head from a heavy blow. It may not have the strength to protect you a second time, even
if it looks undamaged.

:::

#### Watersports

Buoyancy aids are essential for non-swimmers, but life preservers should be worn by EVERYONE who is at risk—canoeists, sailors, windsurfers,
surfers. Never forget that you may be knocked unconscious—it’s not a case of how good a swimmer you are. Wetsuits protect the body from
cold and abrasion. NEVER wear earplugs for diving—the water pressure could force them into your ears.

#### Footwear

Buy the best you can afford and, if possible, have a pair of shoes specifically designed for every sport you play. Many sporting injuries could be
avoided by wearing the correct footwear. A running shoe, for instance, has a wide base which is too stable for the rolling and twisting of the
feet in racquet sports.

Buy shoes with uppers made of natural materials-leather, cotton, canvas. Try shoes on while wearing the same socks you use for sport. REMOVE
plastic motifs from leather or canvas shoes—they don’t expand with the shoe and can cause blisters, sores and chafing. DON’T wear
somebody else’s shoes. You could be asking for verruccas, athlete’s foot or other fungal infections. DON’T play sport
barefoot—your feet need protection and support.

## **Sport by sport**

:::danger

Here’s a summary of the most common , risks of some of the mast common sports. Know YOUR sport and take every precaution to protect
yourself from serious injury. Never forget that, apart from the dangers of permanent damage or death, quite simple injuries may prevent you
from ever participating in your chosen sport again.

### Combat sports

#### Boxing / wrestling / judo / fencing

Most boxing injuries are to the face and head, with concussion a constant danger. Protective headgear can be worn, but some feel this impairs
reflexes, slowing movement and leading to a false sense of security. Amateur boxers are now forced to rest after a knockout to minimize the
likelihood of becoming ‘punch drunk’—a form of irreversible brain damage. Blows to the eye can detach the retina. Both wrestling and
judo are surprisingly-safe sports, probably because they are well supervised, though shoulder separation or dislocation, and fractures of the
ribs, collarbone, fingers or toes do occur in the latter. Some arm positions can also lead to tennis elbow and ligament injury. In fencing, faulty
equipment is often the cause of injuries and accidents.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img178_001.jpg" />

### Contact sports

#### Rugby / australian rules football / american football

Injuries are common in these relatively-violent sports, though they are safer than they used to be—especially American football, thanks to
the extensive padding and protection worn. Collapsing the scrum in rugby is now illegal since players have been paralysed this way. Common
injuries include: shoulder separation; costochondral injuries (front or chest wall where ribs join sternum); quads haematoma; scrum pox (impetigo
of the skin caught from cuts). Back injuries from twisting in the scrum/scrimmage can be minimized by conditioning the muscles; cauliflower ear by
wearing a sweat band. Broken bones and spinal injuries are not uncommon.

### Basketball

#### Netball / handball / volleyball

Dislocated and fractured fingers, mallet finger ([see Field sports](#field-sports)) and thumb sprain all arise from mistimed catches.
Foot injuries and ankle sprains are common due to play on hard surfaces. The actions of jumping, backing and overhead throwing can lead to
jumper’s knee (patella tendinitis-tendon inflammation), footballer’s groin and shoulder problems-typically rotator cuff (tendons on top of
the shoulder joint), rupture and impingement.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img178_002.jpg" />

### Field sports

#### Cricket / baseball / softball

As in other social sports, the under-fit weekend player risks injury. Common complaints include ‘pitcher’s elbow’ (inflammation where
the muscles are attached to the bone), the children’s versions-‘little league elbow’-and radiohumeral joint injury, caused by
round-arm throwing. Fractured or dislocated fingers and mallet finger (a bruised, swollen and often sagging end-joint caused by a blow to the tip)
are hazards of hard ball sports. The actions of bowling, pitching or sliding can also lead to shoulder and back injuries.

### Track and field

<h4 className="mt-5 pt-5 mb-3" id="RUNNING-SPRINTING-LONG-JUMP-HIGH-JUMP-JAVELIN-SHOT-PUT-DISCUS">
RUNNING / SPRINTING / LONG JUMP / HIGH JUMP / JAVELIN / SHOT PUT / DISCUS
</h4>

Running events carry the risk of adductor strain and hamstring sprains-particularly from explosive or sudden movements and one-sided running.
Long-distance runs on hard surfaces leave runners prone to shin splints and stress fractures. Kick-type movements aggravate quads mechanism
injuries (Osgood Schlatter’s disease, or shinbone inflammation and jumper’s knee). Hurdlers or discus throwers can suffer footballer’s
groin. Javelin throwers and shot putters both have their ‘own’ injuries-javelin thrower’s elbow is caused by round-arm throws and shot
putter’s finger is a sprain of the three fingers used for the final acceleration. In high jumpers, Fosbury flop ankle is caused by twisting
the lower leg on take-off.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img178_003.jpg" />

### Golf/hockey

A similar set of back and hamstring injuries can arise from these sports since they’re both played with a bias to one side. In golf, upper
back pain is common, and golfer’s or tennis elbow arises when the club is gripped too tightly or frequently hits the turf. Hockey players are
vulnerable to high knee and hip pain, due to running while bending over, and to footballer’s groin.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img178_005.jpg" />

### Target sports

#### Shooting/archery

Properly supervised, these sports should not be dangerous. In archery, tennis elbow can develop in the bow arm if technique is faulty. In
shooting, elbow and knee pads protect against bursitis. Earmuffs are essential to avoid damage to the tiny bones of the middle ear. Most injuries
are the result of accident. ALWAYS follow the gun code:

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img178_004.jpg" />
- NEVER point a weapon at a person, even in jest
- NEVER let a child play with a gun, even if you’re sure it’s unloaded
- ALWAYS assume a gun IS loaded
- ALWAYS break the gun before putting it in a car or climbing an obstacle
- ALWAYS ensure barrel points to the ground-move stock to barrel
- [See SELF-DEFENCE: The law](/sas-urban/urban-self-defense#the-law)

### Racquet sports

#### Tennis / squash / racquetball / badminton

Tennis elbow (inflammation where the muscle is attached to the bone) is the classic injury, arising from faulty technique in the backhand
(tennis), or from an over-tight grip in the other three sports. An over-tight grip can also lead to “squash player’s finger“. Foot,
ankle, knee and toe injuries are further perils of squash and racquetball, which are often played by the under-fit who come unstuck twisting and
turning at speed, maybe in ill-fitting shoes. Badminton players are prone to shoulder injuries owing to the frequency of overhead shots. Twisting
and lunging are features of this sport too, putting ankles and knees at risk.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img179_001.jpg" />

### Football

Again, inadequate fitness leads to injury, and adductor strain (inside thigh), caused by a kick with the inner side of the foot, and hamstring
sprains are especially common in weekend players. Knees are vulnerable to ligament and cartilage strain or rupture. Shin bone fractures and
sprained ankles are common. Footballer’s ankle occurs when repeated minor injuries have stretched the ligaments, and footballer’s groin (a
loosened symphysis ligament leading to pelvic inflammation) can be caused by sidestepping or backing movements.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img179_003.jpg" />

### Ice sports

#### Skating/ice hockey

Fractures are more common than ligament injuries on ice—radius and scaphoid fractures are the most usual (from falling onto the outstretched
hand) and stress fractures of the tibia (shin) can result from jumps in figure skating. Improved proficiency is your best guard against this.
Ill-fitting boots can lead to ankle ligament strain/rupture or to skater’s heel (inflammation of bursa over heelbone). Full padding/armour is
essential for playing ice hockey, since most injuries result from blows of the puck or stick.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img179_002.jpg" />

### Skiing

Around 30,000 people are injured skiing each year. About half of these result from skiing in off-piste areas, which can be extremely dangerous.
Avalanches and colliding with unanticipated obstacles are among the hazards. The modern ski boot protects against ankle fractures, but puts more
stress on the knee, with ligament strains and ruptures caused by twisting or bending. Have your bindings set locally where they know the
conditions.

Train adequately before you ski. Fatigue leads to mistakes. If you have never been skiing before, take classes to strengthen your muscles
well in advance. ALWAYS ski with a companion, in case you sustain an injury. If you must ski alone, set your bindings Looser-it’s easier to
put a ski back on than to cope alone with a broken leg or twisted ankle.

If you are injured: Apply snow to the injury to reduce swelling. Make a splint from ski sticks or branches. DON’T use outer garments for
bandage or splint. You must keep warm. DON’T walk across snow. Lie on your stomach or skis and slide.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img179_004.jpg" />

### On horseback

In Britain, riding is the commonest cause of death among young girls. Falling off the horse, of course, is the most dangerous hazard, especially
falling onto the head or neck. A proper helmet ([see Clothing](#clothing)) minimizes the risk. If a fallen rider complains of neck
pain, numb or weak limbs, DON’T assume the hat prevented injury, seek urgent medical attention. Other common fall injuries include strained or
ruptured knee ligaments, fractured thigh, shin or collarbones and shoulder separation. Always respect the horse-it is dangerous at both ends (and
uncomfortable in the middle!). Learn some ‘horse sense’-horses are easily startled by sudden noises. Give all hindquarters a wide berth.

### On wheels

<h4 className="mt-5 pt-5 mb-3" id="CYCLING-BMX-ROLLERSKATING-STREET-HOCKEY-SKATEBOARDING">
CYCLING / BMX / ROLLERSKATING / STREET HOCKEY / SKATEBOARDING
</h4>

Falls are VERY common—adequate head protection MUST be worn for all these sports. It may look ‘uncool’ but it could save your life?
For all except cycling, knee and elbow protectors are advisable to protect against jarring blows as well as grazes and cuts. The kneecap is
particularly vulnerable in 12- to 16-year-old girls-any bent-knee exercise puts extra strain on the joint. ’Street’ sports also carry an
increased risk of lung pollution from the carbon monoxide, lead and sulphur compounds in traffic exhaust fumes-the intake of which is increased by
rapid deep breathing.

### Gym sports

#### Aerobics / gymnastics / weights

These three sports are most commonly practised by three distinct groups and cause quite specific injuries. Aerobics has contributed to a rise of
heart attacks in women over 35, who launch too quickly into over-strenuous exercise and fail to recognize warning signs-exhaustion, pain,
discomfort or overheating. Ensure your instructor is up to date in the latest developments of this sport and never ‘go for the burn’.
Ideally, gymnasts need supple joints and ligaments, short stature and nimbleness, which accounts for the sport’s popularity with young girls.
Flexible joints can easily be overstretched, though, and common injuries include sway back elbow (lax ligaments leading to an unstable joint) and
back injuries, caused by frequent hyperextension (overstraightening). Bad technique is the usual route to injury in weightlifting/weight training.
The back must always be straight-a belt helps in this by transferring more force to the abdominals. Too much pressure in the abdomen, and a hernia
(rupture) is possible, or fainting due to blood not returning to the heart and brain. Biceps strain, shoulder separation and chest wall pain are
all hazards of overdoing bench presses.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img180_001.jpg" />

### Watersports

#### Swimming / diving

On the whole, swimming is a very safe sport, and is often used as part of the treatment/therapy for all kinds of sports injuries. Chlorine content
of public baths can lead to conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eye). Conversely, unchlorinated pools carry the risk of bacterial or fungal
infections-from athlete’s foot and verruccas to ear infections and impetigo. Long-distance swimming can cause “swimmer’s shoulder“
(rotator cuff rupture or impingement) or “swimmer’s knee“ (ligament strain) due to over use and/ or bad technique. Diving should
ALWAYS be properly supervised, or potentially fatal neck injuries can result. Impact velocity can lead to wrist, thumb and shoulder injuries.

#### Waterskiing / windsurfing / surfing

A well-fitting wetsuit protects against a high-pressure enema (rectal or vaginal) in waterskiing, hypothermia in windsurfing. Bad posture can lead
to back pain and injuries in both sports-the risk decreases with competence. Life jackets MUST be worn, even by competent swimmers in case of
blows to the head. Waxes used on boards and skis can cause dermatitis. There is a danger with all these sports that you may find yourself far from
shore, or in waters you would not choose for swimming.

### Boats

#### Sailing / canoeing / rowing

Back pain can be a problem, especially in the latter two sports—developing the abdominals guards against this. Paddler’s wrist
(inflammation of tendons on outer side) and tennis elbow can be caused by gripping oars/paddles too hard and twisting. Rowers are prone to
blisters (rub surgical spirit on palms to toughen them or wear gloves) and haemorrhoids (seek medical advice if ‘piles’ persist). Sailing
involves much isometric exercise-where the muscles contract, but the limb is static-and quads strain or abdominal strain are common. Sailors
should also guard against dehydration and hypothermia-take drinking water, wear sun screen and protect the eyes.

<BaseUrlImg src="/images/img180_002.jpg" />

:::danger[Warning]

All watersports should be considered potentially DANGEROUS. Death by drowning is particularly associated with people taking unnecessary risks
or with alcohol/drug use. NEVER drink and swim! Alcohol is thought to be responsible for up to 50% of drowning deaths each year-in Britain
alone, one person under 25 dies each week. Apart from ‘errors of judgement’, alcohol lowers the blood temperature-as does swimming.
This combination alone can be fatal.

NEVER swim within 90 minutes of eating. Blood around the muscles is in short supply and cramps can result. IF you get cramp: stop swimming,
turn onto your back and float. Stretch the cramped muscle. When the cramp eases off, swim to the side using a different stroke.

NEVER dive into very cold water as the shock results in immediate hyperventilation, increased blood pressure and pulse. The shock itself may
kill you. Loss of body heat weakens movement and reduces coordination. This is especially dangerous if you are elderly, convalescent or unfit.

NEVER swim in flooded sand or gravel pits or quarries. Submerged objects are dangerous and steeply-shelving sides may make climbing out
impossible.
